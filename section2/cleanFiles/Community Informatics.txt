this
proposal
is
for
three
papers
which
would
form
all
or
part
of
a
|||
panel
presentation
reporting
current
work
in
community
informatics
at
|||
three
ischools
|||
it
complements
the
wildcard
proposal
submitted
on
|||
community
technologyinformationinformatics
which
we
are
each
also
|||
part
of
|||
if
there
are
other
paper
proposals
in
this
area
we
would
be
|||
glad
to
be
combined
in
one
session
with
them
|||
as
per
the
request
for
anonymity
the
paper
numbers
correspond
to
the
|||
authors
index
in
the
webform
|||
all
three
of
us
will
present

paper
top
data
archive
repurposing
data
to
advance
the
emerging
|||
field
of
community
informatics
|||
when
a
federal
program
which
funded
community
informatics
projects
|||
over
years
was
shut
down
researchers
and
staff
worked
to
repurpose
|||
their
files
into
a
research
dataset
|||
organizing
the
|||
physicalplusdigital
archive
into
a
distributed
collection
proved
to
be
|||
effective
teaching
and
research
at
two
ischools
and
one
library
school
|||
a
number
of
scholars
across
several
disciplines
are
now
using
the
|||
dataset
for
their
investigations
|||
to
our
knowledge
there
is
no
other
|||
shared
community
informatics
dataset
|||
analysis
of
the
top
data
is
deepening
our
understanding
of
several
|||
questions
among
them
how
social
capital
and
social
networks
interact
|||
with
technology
in
local
communities
and
allowing
us
to
inform
|||
policymakers
interested
in
top
|||
the
presentation
will
report
the

methods
used
and
the
results
thus

paper
identifying
communitycentered
outcomes
|||
nonprofits
still
struggle
as
they
attempt
to
effectively
identify
|||
specific
outcomes
of
their
services
that
accrue
to
individuals
their
|||
families
community
groups
and
the
larger
community
|||
these
skills
are
|||
essential
both
to
communityfocused
icts
libraries
and
other
nonprofit
|||
staff
and
to
students
who
seek
to
build
their
careers
in
these
|||
institutions
|||
faculty
at
ischools
that
have
embraced
community
|||
informatics
are
now
beginning
to
give
students
the
knowledge
and
|||
experience
needed
to
help
community
organizations
more
effectively
meet
|||
community
needs
and
tell
their
story
|||
this
presentation
will
provide
a
|||
contextual
framework
for
identifying
and
presenting
outcomes
|||
more
|||
importantly
it
will
provide
examples
of
outcomes
identified
by
graduate
|||
students
who
have
conducted
fieldbased
outcome
studies
of
a
variety
of

community

paper
theorizing
community
informatics
memory
practices
in
online
|||
communities
|||
based
in
the
insight
that
digital
archiving
is
a
fundamental
process
in
|||
the
sciences
bowker
has
proposed
the
concept
of
memory
practices
|||
as
a
way
to
understand
a
new
regime
of
information
and
communication
|||
technologies
for
recording
and
storing
memory
|||
he
argues
that
these
|||
practices
are
technical
and
social
and
include
shared
standards
|||
meanings
and
protocols
they
allow
data
and
information
to
be
stored
and
|||
forgotten
and
then
retrieved
and
remembered
|||
in
his
view
they
are
|||
routine
components
of
of
work
practices
imposing
order
on
things
|||
holding
and
shaping
experience
|||
this
paper
explores
the
utility
of
|||
memory
practices
seen
here
as
technologies
of
remembering
and
|||
forgetting
for
understanding
the
infrastructures
on
which
online
|||
communities
depend
