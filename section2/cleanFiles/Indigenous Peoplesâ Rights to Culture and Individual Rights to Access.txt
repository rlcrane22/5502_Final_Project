using

of
philosophical

concepts
from
moral
and

political
philosophy
indigenous
peoples
human
right
to
control
access
|||
to
their
cultural
information
is
defended
|||
the
concept
of
a
right
|||
is
delineated
and
different
types
of
rights
are
differentiated
|||
the
|||
method
of
an
overlapping
consensus
is
used
|||
in
attempting
to
|||
articulate
the
moral
foundation
for
indigenous
peoples
rights
to
|||
culture
we
can
start
with
justifications
for
limiting
access
that
are
|||
already
widely
accepted
within
our
society
|||
these
widely
accepted
|||
justifications
for
controlling
or
limiting
access
to
information
include
|||
the
claim
that
said
information
is
a
under
copyright
b
a
trade
or
|||
state
secret
c
harmful
to
some
segment
of
society
or
is
d
private
|||
or
confidential
|||
the
moral
grounds
for
each
of
these
limitations
on
|||
free
access
is
explored
|||
ac
are
found
to
not
provide
an
adequate
|||
ground
for
indigenous
peoples
rights
to
control
access
to
their
|||
culture
|||
the
cultural
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
are
defended
as
a
|||
form
of
group
privacy
|||
two
possible
moral
dangers
of
this
defense
of
|||
indigenous
peoples
rights
to
culture
are
considered
|||
it
is
shown
that
|||
on
a
properly
nuanced
understanding
of
the
contours
of
the
indigenous
|||
peoples
rights
to
group
privacy
they
do
not
give
rise

of

these

introduction
|||
nonindigenous
americans
belong
to
a
national
culture
that
has
benefited
|||
from
their
past
and
ongoing
oppression
and
destruction
of
native
|||
american
peoples
and
cultures
|||
as
such
we
share
along
with
other
|||
colonial
and
majority
populations
a
collective
responsibility
to
these
|||
peoples
|||
thus
nonnative
persons
organizations
and
governments
have
|||
good
reasons
to
support
any
efforts
on
the
part
of
native
peoples
to
|||
assert
their
rights
|||
one
of
the
persisting
harms
done
to
indigenous
|||
peoples
is
the
attempted
destruction
of
their
cultures
|||
this
attempted
|||
destruction
has
been
twofold
|||
first
is
the
attempted
forced
|||
assimilation
of
indigenous
peoples
into
the
culture
of
the
colonizers
|||
the
second
is
the
appropriation
of
that
culture
through
unethical
|||
anthropological
practices
as
well
as
the
collection
and
fetishization
|||
of
native
cultures
as
representations
of
the
exotic
authentic
|||
spiritual
or
savage
|||
in
this
context
the
movements
of
indigenous
peoples
around
the
world
to
|||
reassert
their
connection
to
their
cultural
heritage
are
a
positive
|||
sign
|||
this
assertion
has
already
affected
the
practice
of
archaeology
|||
anthropology
and
other
disciplines
that
focus
on
researching
indigenous
|||
peoples
and
cultures
|||
indigenous
peoples
continued
efforts
to
get
|||
back
control
of
their
cultural
heritage
has
and
will
continue
to
have
|||
important
implications
for
those
concerned
with
collecting
storing
|||
organizing
and
providing
access
to
cultural
information
e
|||
g
|||
libraries
archives
and
museums
|||
on
september
the
united
nations
general
assembly
adopted
the
|||
declaration
on
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
undri
|||
the
undri
|||
asserts
group
rights
of
cultural
possession
and
control
which
should
be
|||
of
central
interest
to
those
in
the
field
of
information
|||
according
to
|||
article
of
the
undri
for
example
indigenous
peoples
have
rights
to
|||
maintain
control
protect
and
develop
their
intellectual
property
|||
overcultural
heritage
traditional
knowledge
and
traditional
|||
cultural
expressions
|||
and
according
to
article
indigenous
|||
peoples
have
the
right
to
redress
for
or
restitution
of
cultural
|||
intellectual
religious
and
spiritual
property
taken
without
their
free
|||
prior
and
informed
consent
or
in
violation
of
their
laws
traditions
and
|||
customs
|||
these
provisions
express
the
ideals
behind
a
worldwide
|||
movement
by
indigenous
peoples
to
reclaim
their
cultural
heritage
|||
the
question
for
those
interested
in
the
preservation
and
free
flow
of
|||
information
is
how
to
balance
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
to
|||
culture
with
the
rights
of
individuals
to
access
information
|||
in
order
|||
to
determine
where
this
balance
might
be
we
need
a
deeper
understanding
|||
of
the
grounds
of
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
over
their
cultural
|||
information
|||
only
if
we
understand
the
justification
for
and
the
|||
function
of
these
rights
can
we
understand
fully
what
they
may
|||
reasonably
demand
of
us
|||
providing
such
a
justification
is
the
goal
of
|||
this
paper
|||
the
protocols
for
native
american
archival
material
and
restrictions
|||
on
access
|||
recently
a
number
of
native
and
nonnative
american
librarians
and
|||
archivists
collaboratively
drafted
the
protocols
for
native
american
|||
archival
material
pnaam

pnaam
describes
in

what
these

professionals
and

consider
the
best

in
the

housed

|||
discussions
of
indigenous
cultural
rights
particularly
in
the
united
|||
states
cannot
be
understood
without
some
familiarity
with
the
native
|||
american
grave
protection
and
repatriation
act
nagpra
|||
nagpra
which
|||
was
passed
in
requires
the
cataloguing
and
repatriation
of
native
|||
american
human
remains
funerary
objects
and
objects
of
cultural
|||
patrimony
|||
according
to
the
national
nagpra
report
so
far
there
|||
have
been
notices
of
intent
to
repatriate
publishedwhich
account
|||
for
funerary
objects
sacred
objects
objects
of
|||
cultural
patrimony
and
sacred
objects
that
are
also
cultural
|||
patrimony
|||
n
group
or
culture
itself
rather
than
property
owned
by
anindividual
|||
native
american
and
which
therefore
cannot
be
alienated
|||
appropriated
or
conveyed
by
any
individual
regardless
of
whether
or
not
|||
the
individual
is
a
member
of
the
indian
tribe
or
native
hawaiian
|||
organization
and
such
object
shall
have
been
considered
inalienable
by
|||
such
native
american
group
at
the
time
the
object
wasseparated
from
|||
such
group
|||
some
have
argued
that
the
cultural
patrimony
section
of
the
law
covers
|||
information
objects
such
as
songs
descriptions
or
pictures
of
rituals
|||
etc
|||
however
the
language
of
it
being
an
object
implies
that
it
|||
does
not
cover
information
which
is
not
typically
described
as
an
|||
object
|||
we
can
make
a
distinction
between
an
objectsuch
as
a
|||
manuscript
describing
a
ritual
recording
of
a
song
picture
of
a
|||
basket
and
the
information
contained
in
that
object
|||
thus
even
if
|||
nagrpa
covers
the
returning
of
the
object
our
question
is
whether
it
|||
includes
the
return
of
control
over
the
information
contained
in
|||
the
object
|||
compare
the
rights
i
may
have
in
a
painting
and
the
rights
i
|||
have
in
any
reproductions
of
that
painting
|||
if
someone
steals
the
|||
painting
from
me
i
have
rights
to
have
the
painting
returned
but
i
do
|||
not
necessarily
have
any
rights
in
reproductions
|||
the
right
in
|||
reproductions
may
be
with
someone
else
e
|||
g
|||
the
artist
or
it
may
be
|||
in
the
public
domain
|||
while
nagpra
provides
us
with
a
model
of
how
|||
cataloguing
and
repatriation
works
and
thus
provides
a
guide
for
how
|||
such
cataloging
and
repatriation
might
go
for
cultural
information
|||
nagpra
itself
does
not
presently
provide
a
legal
requirement
for
the
|||
cataloguing
or
repatriation
of
cultural
information
|||
the
provisions
of
pnaam
|||
pnaam
is
particularly
laudable
insofar
as
it
tries
to
balance
the
rights
|||
and
responsibilities
of
both
tribes
and
nontribal
information
stewards
|||
by
providing
a
list
of
best
practices
for
both
communities
|||
it
calls
for
|||
the
creation
of
relationships
between
the
tribes
and
archives
|||
thus
|||
anyone
dealing
with
native
american
archival
materials
must
read
and
|||
seriously
consider
pnaam
|||
to
give
a
sense
of
the
suggestions
in
pnaam
it
is
worth
quoting
some
of
|||
the
recommendations
at
length
|||
with
regard
to
removal
or
intentional
|||
nonpreservation
of
information
objects
pnaam
states
that
some
|||
items
such
as
a
photograph
of
a
sacred
ceremony
or
object
or
|||
culturally
sensitive
documentation
of
a
burial
should
not
be
preserved
|||
forever
or
may
need
to
be
restricted
or
repatriated
to
the
culturally
|||
affiliated
group
|||
with
regard
to
restricted
access
pnaam
states
|||
that
archivists
and
others
ought
to
respect
a
communitys
request
|||
to
restrict
access
to
and
use
of
materials
that
describe
and
represent
|||
esoteric
ceremonial
or
religious
knowledge
that
is
significant
to
the
|||
community
|||
clearly
although
such
material
may
be
in
the
form
of
|||
original
documents
in
an
archive
it
may
also
be
included
in
published
|||
works
held
by
academic
and
public
libraries
|||
thus
the
same
reasoning
|||
that
would
lead
to
restricting
access
to
archival
materials
which
|||
represents
such
knowledge
would
lead
to
restricting
access
to
published
|||
works
that
represent
such
knowledge
|||
intellectual
freedom
and
the
information
professions
|||
a
number
of
authors
in
both
philosophy
and
lis
have
argued
that
access
|||
to
information
is
key
to
our
capacity
to
enjoy
our
democratic
and
|||
personal
freedoms
|||
alfino
and
pierce

argue
that
|||
information
in
the
context
of
guided

development
of
personal
autonomy
and
personal

|||
information
|||
professionals
particularly
in
the
u

s
|||
context
see
their
profession
as
|||
devoted
to
intellectual
freedom
and
the
public
domain
|||
the
american
|||
library
association
for
instance
proclaims
that
intellectual
freedom
|||
is
the
right
of
every
individual
to
both
seek
and
receive
information
|||
from
all
points
of
view
without

it
provides
for

to
all
expressions
of
ideas
through
which
any
and
all
sides
of
a

question
cause
or
movement
may
be
explored
|||
intellectual
freedom
|||
encompasses
the
freedom
to
hold
receive
and
disseminate
ideas
|||
emphasis
added
|||
these
values
are
also
embedded
in
the
united
|||
states
constitution
|||
the
u
|||
s
|||
supreme
court
has
held
that
access
to
|||
information
is
a
constitutional
right
|||
the
right
of
freedom
of

speech
and
press
includes
not
only
the
right
to
utter
or
to

the

|||
this
commitment
makes
any
contentbased
restriction
on
access
to
|||
information
is
suspect
|||
a
possible
case
might
make
the
possible
|||
concerns
clearer
|||
suppose
for
example
that
a
student
researching
|||
folklore
wishes
to
access
a
recording
of
a
traditional
song
held
by
a
|||
library
or
archive
|||
perhaps
he
or
she
wishes
to
determine
whether
or
|||
how
this
story
might
be
related
to
stories
in
other
cultures
|||
suppose
|||
that
after
the
library
or
archive
consults
with
the
tribe
from
which
|||
the
story
originated
the
tribe
wishes
to
deny
access
to
anyone
engaged
|||
in
this
sort
of
research
|||
ought
the
library
to
restrict
access
what
|||
would
the
library
bill
of
rights
lbr
for
example
advise
a
librarian
|||
or
other
information
professional
to
do
|||
according
to
article
three
of
the
lbr
libraries
should
challenge
|||
censorship
in
the
fulfillment
of
their
responsibility
to
provide
|||
information
and
enlightenment
it
may
appear
that
restricting
|||
access
to
information
because
a
particular
group
does
not
want
outsiders
|||
to
know
the
information
amounts
to
censorship
|||
even
if
such
limitations
|||
are
not
censorship
per
se
they
may
still
illegitimately
infringe
|||
our
rights
to
access
information
|||
indeed
the
lbr
recognizes
that
there
|||
are
a
wide
range
of
ways
in
which
our
rights
of
expression
and
access
|||
may
be
abridged
and
calls
for
resisting
them
|||
according
to
article
four
|||
of
the
lbr
libraries
should
cooperate
with
all
persons
and
groups
|||
concerned
with
resisting
abridgment
of
free
expression
and
free
access
|||
to
ideas
|||
and
article
five
of
lbr
seems
to
pose
some
serious
|||
problems
for
some
of
the
best
practices
listed
in
pnaam
|||
furthermore
|||
if
groups
wish
to
limit
access
to
works
based
on
the
ethnic
origin
|||
e
|||
g
|||
whether
or
not
one
is
a
tribal
member
age
or
gender
of
the
|||
patron
this
may
conflict
with
the
requirement
of
the
lbr
that
a
|||
persons
right
to
use
a
library
should
not
be
denied
or
abridged
|||
because
of
origin
age
background
or
views
|||
in
order
to
answer
our
question
of
how
to
balance
the
rights
of
|||
indigenous
peoples
to
their
culture
with
the
rights
of
individuals
to
|||
access
information
we
need
to
have
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
grounds
|||
for
these
rights
|||
only
if
we
understand
the
justification
for
and
|||
function
of
these
rights
can
we
understand
fully
what
they
demand
of
us
|||
and
what
they
require
|||
since
the
focus
here
is
on
the
rights
of
|||
indigenous
peoples
to
control
access
to
information
and
the
rights
of
|||
individuals
to
access
information
it
will
be
worthwhile
to
familiarize
|||
ourselves
a
bit
with
the
literature
on
rights
|||
rights
|||
both
those
who
champion
individual
rights
to
access
and
use
information
|||
and
those
who
assert
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
over
this
|||
information
use
the
language
of
rights
|||
this
is
most
clear
in
the
|||
the
united
nations
declaration
on
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
and
|||
the
library
bill
of
rights
|||
however
it
is
also
a
powerful
theme
in
|||
pnaam
which
states
for
example
that
libraries
and
archives
must
|||
recognize
that
native
american
communities
have
primary
rights
for
all
|||
culturally
sensitive
materials
that
are
culturally
affiliated
with
|||
them
|||
these
rights
apply
to
issues
of
collection
preservation
|||
access
and
use
of
or
restrictions
to
these
materials
emphasis
|||
added
|||
it
will
be
useful
then
to
briefly
discuss
what
rights
are
|||
and
more
specifically
how
we
should
understand
the
rights
claimed
by
|||
those
advocating
access
and
those
advocating
the
rights
to
control
|||
access
and
use
of
information
|||
typically
when
someone
says
that
they
have
a
right
to
x
they
are
|||
referring
to
what
the
rights
theorist
w
|||
h
|||
hohfeld
called
claim
|||
rights
|||
if
i
have
a
claim
right
to
read
for
example
that
|||
means
that
others
would
have
correlative
duties
that
they
ought
to
|||
fulfill
|||
if
i
have
a
claim
right
to
read
a
book
then
you
may
have
some
|||
sort
of
duty
to
make
the
world
such
that
i
actually
can
effectively
|||
read
|||
if
you
fail
to
do
your
duty
then
you
are
violating
my
|||
right
|||
your
duty
might
be
to
not
interfere
|||
so
for
example
in
|||
asserting
my
right
to
read
i
may
be
saying
that
you
have
a
duty
to
you
|||
refrain
from
criticizing
me
publicly
for
reading
the
book
turning
off
|||
the
lights
so
i
cant
read
the
book
or
to
remove
the
book
from
the
|||
public
library
|||
or
your
duty
may
be
to
actual
in
some
way
assist
me
|||
so
for
example
others
may
be
obligated
to
fund
public
schools
where
i
|||
would
be
taught
to
read
and
public
libraries
that
would
stock
this
and
|||
other
books
|||
rights
theorists
typically
call
the
right
imposes
for
|||
first
sort
of
duty
on
others
a
negative
or
liberty
right
and
the
right
|||
that
imposes
for
second
sort
of
duty
on
others
a
positive
or
welfare
|||
right
|||
in
other
words
if
i
have
a
liberty
right
to
read
then
|||
others
are
obligated
to
refrain
from
interfering
with
my
reading
|||
if
i
|||
have
a
welfare
right
to
read
others
are
obligated
to
provide
me
the
|||
conditions
necessary
for
reading
|||
below
i
will
often
talk
about
the
contours
of
a
right
|||
it
is
worth
|||
saying
a
bit
here
about
what
i
mean
by
that
|||
we
often
think
of
rights
|||
as
simpleyou
have
a
right
or
you
dont
|||
so
for
example
if
i
|||
have
a
property
right
to
my
car
then
we
might
think
of
it
as
a
sort
of
|||
bubble
around
my
cari
can
do
what
i
want
with
my
cardent
it
with
a
|||
hammer
paint
it
bright
pink
and
others
cannot
do
things
to
my
car
|||
without
my
permission
|||
but
rights
are
almost
never
so
simple
|||
there
are
|||
all
sorts
of
things
that
i
am
not
allowed
to
do
to
or
with
my
cari
|||
cannot
drive
it
miles
an
hour
on
a
city
street
i
cannot
drive
a
car
|||
that
pollutes
etc
|||
thus
my
rights
to
my
car
do
not
form
a
sort
of
|||
smooth
circle
around
my
car
but
rather
has
contours
of
what
i
can
and
|||
cannot
do
in
relation
to
my
car
|||
consider
my
right
to
read
again
|||
we
often
say
that
we
have
a
|||
constitutional
right
to
read
what
we
wishagain
it
is
as
if
there
is
a
|||
bubble
of
protection
around
our
acts
of
reading
that
forbid
others
from
|||
interfering
with
them
|||
but
this
bubble
is
dented
with
all
sorts
of
|||
exceptions
|||
you
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
read
others
|||
private
medical
records
to
read
pirated
copies
of
a
work
to
read
|||
documents
that
contain
national
secrets
or
to
read
slanderous
remarks
|||
about
someone
|||
in
all
these
cases
the
government
is
permitted
to
pass
|||
laws
to
restrict
our
access
to
such
works
|||
our
rights
to
read
have
|||
contours
that
are
quite
complex
|||
given
this
the
mere
fact
that
one
has
|||
a
right
with
regard
to
x
does
not
answer
the
question
as
to
|||
whether
one
can
do
some
particular
thing
with
regard
to
x
|||
it
will
|||
depend
on
the
precise
contours
of
the
right
in
question
|||
in
particular
|||
exactly
what
actions
does
the
right
authorize
|||
with
this
account
of
rights
at
our
disposal
we
can
characterize
what
the
|||
potential
conflict
between
claims
of
rights
to
culture
and
claims
to
|||
freedom
of
access
|||
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
view
that
indigenous
|||
peoples
have
a
right
to
control
access
to
cultural
information
|||
this
|||
means
that
if
they
wish
they
may
assert
a
right
that
with
regard
to
|||
certain
information
it
be
destroyed
all
copies
be
returned
to
the
|||
group
or
that
while
the
information
objects
may
remain
outside
the
|||
direct
physical
control
of
the
group
access
this
information
should
be
|||
restricted
according
to
the
wishes
of
the
group
|||
such
a
right
would
|||
place
a
duty
on
others
to
refrain
from
accessing
this
information
and
|||
may
place
a
duty
on
the
current
stewards
of
the
information
to
|||
ensure
that
the
rights
of
indigenous
people
with
regard
to
this
|||
information
are
respected
|||
since
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
place
|||
a
duty
on
others
not
to
access
information
in
some
cases
this
means
|||
that
outsiders
would
not
be
free
to
access
such
materials
|||
overlapping
consensus
|||
many
have
noted
that
indigenous
peoples
have
unique
perspectives
on
the
|||
world
that
provide
an
important
alternative
to
western
perspectives
|||
as
|||
ermine
notes
western
and
indigenous
peoples
have
disparate
|||
worldviews
each
formed
and
guided
by
distinct
histories
knowledge
|||
traditions
values
interests
and
social
economic
and
political
|||
realities
|||
indeed
this
difference
is
often
cited
as
an
|||
important
reason
that
such
cultures
ought
to
be
protected
and
preserved
|||
however
the
fact
that
indigenous
peoples
have
unique
worldviews
|||
creates
a
special
challenge
to
any
theorist
trying
to
provide
a
|||
discussion
of
the
reasons
that
might
support
their
rights
claims
|||
indigenous
peoples
themselves
may
have
unique
beliefs
about
the
world
|||
and
their
place
in
it
that
grounds
their
claims
to
various
cultural
|||
rights
|||
nonindigenous
peoples
should
recognize
the
importance
that
such
|||
beliefs
have
for
indigenous
peoples
and
ideally
could
learn
new
and
|||
possibly
better
ways
of
being
in
the
world
|||
nevertheless
if
as
a
|||
matter
of
fact
nonindigenous
peoples
do
not
share
these
views
then
the
|||
reasons
that
may
be
compelling
for
indigenous
peoples
will
have
no
grip
|||
on
nonindigenous
peoples
|||
john
rawls
was
the
preeminent
political
philosopher
of
the
late
th
and
|||
early
st
century
|||
rawls
developed
a
theory
of
how
principles
of
|||
justice
might
be
grounded
and
justified
without
appealing
to
what
he
|||
called
controversial
metaphysical
commitments
|||
rawls
argued
that
|||
in
a
pluralistic
society
such
as
many
of
us
live
in
we
cannot
expect
|||
that
people
share
the
same
values
metaphysical
or
spiritual
|||
perspectives
and
beliefs
|||
he
argued
however
that
in
such
a
|||
society
we
can
agree
on
shared
principles
via
an
overlapping
|||
consensus
|||
we
can
each
support
a
principle
from
our
own
perspective
|||
while
understanding
the
perspectives
of
the
others
|||
a
simple
example
|||
from
the
united
states
context
will
illustrate
this
|||
consider
the
idea
|||
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state
|||
both
religious
and
nonreligious
|||
people
can
accept
this
principle
as
expressing
the
idea
of
the
freedom
|||
of
conscience
|||
however
the
religious
person
may
be
committed
to
such
a
|||
principle
on
the
grounds
that
persons
should
come
to
god
as
a
matter
of
|||
individual
conscience
which
would
be
interfered
with
if
the
state
in
|||
any
way
mandated
a
particular
religion
or
religious
instruction
|||
the
|||
atheist
may
be
committed
to
such
a
principle
on
the
grounds
that
|||
religions
are
all
equally
false
but
given
that
people
are
personally
|||
committed
to
them
they
should
be
free
to
indulge
in
their
religious
|||
beliefs
and
practices
as
much
as
any
other
private
club
or
activity
|||
the
religious
person
and
the
atheist
do
not
have
to
share
robust
|||
worldviews
including
spiritual
metaphysical
or
moral
beliefs
in
order
|||
to
share
a
commitment
to
the
principle
of
the
separation
of
church
and
|||
state
|||
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
view
is
not
based
on
skepticism
about
|||
whether
there
is
moral
or
religious
truth
|||
rather
it
is
based
on
the
|||
philosophical
and
practical
recognition
that
reasonable
persons
differ
|||
on
such
issues
|||
the
fact
that
people
differ
is
not
based
on
the
|||
ignorance
or
perfidy
of
some
|||
thoughtful
and
intelligent
persons
of
|||
good
will
can
have
very
different
views
about
the
nature
of
the
universe
|||
and
the
place
of
human
beings
in
this
universe
|||
in
the
rest
of
this
|||
paper
i
try
to
find
principles
which
can
form
the
basis
of
an
|||
overlapping
consensus
of
both
indigenous
and
nonindigenous
peoples
|||
justifications
for
limiting
access
to
information
|||
as
noted
above
rights
are
always
complex
|||
to
say
we
have
a
right
to
free
|||
speech
is
not
to
say
that
we
can
say
whatever
we
want
or
publish
|||
whatever
we
want
|||
there
are
many
limitations
on
free
speech
with
which
|||
we
are
quite
comfortable
and
familiar
|||
we
often
do
not
think
of
them
as
|||
limitations
because
we
simply
dont
think
of
certain
activities
as
|||
being
covered
by
a
right
to
free
speech
|||
here
i
am
going
to
focus
on
|||
the
limitations
standardly
found
in
u
|||
s
|||
law
|||
we
we
can
roughly
|||
categorize
such
rationales
for
limiting
speech
as
the
following
|||
copyright
or
intellectual
property
more
generally
secrecy
including
|||
government
secrecy
and
trade
secrets
harmful
material
including
such
|||
things
as
obscenity
and
child
pornography
and
privacy
|||
intellectual
property
|||
the
most
commonly
given
account
of
the
basis
of
the
putative
right
of
|||
indigenous
peoples
to
control
access
to
cultural
information
is
|||
intellectual
property
|||
the
rights
of
authors
under
copyright
include
|||
the
exclusive
right
to
publish
a
work
to
publicly
display
the
work
to
|||
make
copies
of
the
work
and
to
create
derivative
works
based
on
the
|||
original
work
|||
if
indigenous
peoples
hold
copyright
in
their
|||
cultural
information
then
it
would
be
prohibited
for
outsiders
to
|||
reproduce
cultural
information
to
display
it
or
to
copy
it
|||
so
for
|||
example
it
would
prohibit
a
person
from
placing
a
traditional
song
|||
image
or
story
on
the
internet
without
the
prior
permission
of
the
|||
tribe
to
whom
this
song
image
or
story
belongs
|||
the
foundational
idea
of
intellectual
property
is
that
authors
have
|||
rights
in
their
creations
|||
and
in
many
cases
the
author
of
a
work
|||
is
not
a
single
individual
but
a
group
of
individuals
|||
in
such
cases
|||
the
copyright
is
often
held
by
a
collective
entity
of
which
these
|||
individuals
are
members
|||
think
for
example
of
the
copyright
that
is
|||
held
by
the
disney
corporation
|||
the
works
in
question
are
often
the
|||
creation
of
a
large
number
of
persons
working
together
under
the
aegis
|||
of
disney
|||
similarly
traditional
songs
stories
visual
works
etc
|||
are
|||
the
creations
of
individual
indigenous
persons
working
together
as
|||
members
of
a
particular
tribe
|||
following
the
logic
of
intellectual
|||
property
indigenous
peoples
would
have
authorship
rights
in
their
|||
culture
because
it
is
their
collective
creation
|||
there
are
a
number
of
ways
in
which
copyright
seems
exactly
suited
to
|||
the
sorts
of
rights
that
indigenous
peoples
claim
in
their
cultural
|||
information
|||
however
there
are
a
number
of
features
of
copyright
at
|||
least
as
it
has
been
established
in
the
u
|||
s
|||
constitution
and
law
that
|||
make
it
a
poor
fit
as
a
paradigm
for
the
rights
that
indigenous
peoples
|||
have
in
relation
to
their
cultural
information
|||
first
the
tradition
of
copyright
in
the
angloamerican
context
has
|||
always
been
that
it
is
time
limited
|||
indeed
originally
copyright
could
|||
only
be
held
for
years
with
one
possible
extension
|||
even
now
|||
while
the
period
of
copyright
has
been
significantly
extended
to
life
|||
of
the
author
plus
years
or
for
corporations
years
after
the
|||
publication
of
the
work
|||
the
idea
behind
these
limitations
is
that
the
|||
rights
of
authors
to
their
cultural
property
must
be
balanced
against
|||
the
importance
of
the
free
flow
of
information
characterized
by
the
|||
public
domain
|||
even
if
we
argued
that
all
cultural
information
should
|||
now
be
repatriated
based
on
the
argument
that
past
publication
of
the
|||
works
were
forced
rather
than
a
genuine
choice
of
the
peoples
in
|||
question
any
future
publication
public
performance
etc
|||
of
the
works
|||
would
start
the
clock
ticking
|||
indigenous
peoples
would
likely
not
be
|||
happy
with
the
thought
that
if
they
in
any
way
publicly
share
their
|||
culture
they
will
lose
rights
over
it
in
one
hundred
years
|||
they
|||
precisely
do
not
conceive
of
their
culture
as
something
that
can
go
into
|||
the
public
domain
of
the
larger
culture
to
be
used
as
persons
wish
|||
second
in
order
for
a
work
to
qualify
for
copyright
it
must
be
fixed
|||
in
a
tangible
form
of
expression
|||
thus
for
cultures
that
|||
have
traditionally
had
strong
oral
traditions
where
works
may
not
be
|||
written
down
copyright
would
not
cover
such
cultural
information
|||
indeed
as
long
as
a
work
is
oral
and
not
written
the
copyright
would
|||
belong
to
the
person
or
group
who
records
or
writes
down
a
story
or
|||
song
not
to
the
person
or
group
who
originated
the
story
or
song
|||
third
the
rights
of
authors
under
copyright
only
cover
the
form
of
the
|||
expression
not
the
idea
or
story
expressed
|||
with
regard
to
a
story
|||
for
example
it
covers
the
actual
words
used
to
tell
the
story
not
the
|||
form
or
type
of
story
itself
|||
this
is
even
more
true
for
descriptions
|||
of
practices
|||
while
an
indigenous
group
may
have
copyright
on
a
|||
particular
description
of
a
practice
that
they
engage
in
they
do
not
|||
have
copyright
over
the
description
of
this
practice
|||
and
unless
they
|||
write
down
or
record
the
particular
movements
of
the
practice
they
have
|||
no
copyright
over
it
if
others
come
to
know
about
it
|||
finally
even
if
indigenous
peoples
were
willing
to
accept
time
limits
|||
or
even
if
we
were
willing
to
remove
the
time
limits
in
cases
of
|||
indigenous
cultural
information
there
are
fair
use
exceptions
to
all
|||
of
the
exclusive
rights
that
authors
have
in
their
works
|||
no
author
has
|||
complete
control
over
his
or
her
works
|||
others
may
use
or
quote
from
|||
the
work
for
the
purposes
of
commentary
and
criticism
|||
others
may
use
|||
small
pieces
not
central
to
the
work
in
transformative
uses
|||
and
|||
if
the
use
is
for
scholarly
as
opposed
to
monetary
gain
there
is
more
|||
room
for
fair
use
|||
it
is
not
clear
that
indigenous
peoples
would
find
|||
such
exceptions
acceptable
|||
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
indigenous
|||
peoples
only
object
to
their
works
being
used
by
others
for
monetary
|||
gain
|||
it
is
the
inappropriate
access
and
use
of
such
information
that
|||
is
the
problem
and
the
inappropriateness
can
equally
be
in
someone
who
|||
is
using
the
works
for
scholarly
or
educational
purposes
|||
secrecytrade
and
state
|||
the
law
also
protects
the
right
of
certain
groups
to
keep
information
|||
secret
|||
some
of
this
falls
under
the
rubric
of
intellectual
property
in
|||
the
form
of
trade
secrets
|||
there
are
also
laws
protecting
state
|||
secrets
|||
some
have
argued
that
trade
or
state
secrets
are
the
right
|||
model
for
justifying
and
protecting
indigenous
peoples
rights
to
their
|||
cultural
property
|||
according
to
the
uniform
trade
secrets
act
a
trade
secret
is
|||
information
including
a
formula
pattern
compilation
program
|||
device
method
technique
or
process
that

derives

economic

potential
from
not
being
generally
known
to
|||
and
not
being
readily
ascertainable
by
proper
means
by
other
persons
|||
who
can
obtain
economic
value
from
its
disclosure
or
use
and
ii
is
|||
the
subject
of
efforts
that
are
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
to
|||
maintain
its
secrecy
|||
there
are
features
of
trade
secrecy
that
again
seem
to
make
it
a
poor
|||
fit
for
indigenous
peoples
rights
to
cultural
information
|||
it
is
|||
like
other
things
covered
by
intellectual
property
law
intended
to
|||
promote
discovery
and
innovation
|||
the
idea
is
that
people
will
not
be
|||
able
to
spend
the
time
as
a
group
developing
new
products
inventions
|||
or
techniques
if
their
work
can
be
taken
and
used
by
others
|||
in
|||
particular
the
focus
is
on
economic
or
monetary
value
that
a
secret
may
|||
potentially
have
had
|||
thus
the
value
that
indigenous
persons
may
place
|||
on
some
information
being
secret
is
not
captured
in
the
current
law
on
|||
trade
secrets
|||
some
have
suggested
that
indigenous
cultural
information
is
akin
to
|||
state
secrets
|||
in
one
way
state
secrets
seem
a
better
fit
|||
they
do
not
|||
focus
on
monetary
value
or
in
promoting
innovation
|||
however
they
do
|||
focus
on
protecting
security
|||
according
to
the
united
states
court
of
|||
appeals
the
state
secrets
privilege
is
a
hyperlink
|||
httpen
|||
wikipedia
|||
orgwikicommonlaw
common
law
evidentiary
rule
|||
that
allows
the
government
to
withhold
information
from
discovery
when
|||
disclosure
would
be
inimical
to
national
security
|||
it
is
not
|||
clear
that
all
or
even
most
the
cultural
information
that
indigenous
|||
peoples
would
want
to
protect
would
fall
under
the
concept
of
a
state
|||
secret
necessary
to
protect
security
|||
if
it
is
protect
the
security
of
|||
their
land
then
this
may
give
indigenous
persons
an
internal
reason
to
|||
have
customs
policies
or
laws
protecting
such
information
|||
this
would
|||
limit
the
information
so
protected
to
that
which
could
be
legitimately
|||
understood
as
necessary
to
protect
the
security
of
the
indigenous
people
|||
in
question
|||
furthermore
the
idea
that
certain
information
is
|||
secret
depends
on
the
fact
that
they
have
not
been
revealed
|||
there
|||
seems
to
be
little
sense
in
saying
that
something
that
has
been
|||
published
and
has
been
widely
available
in
libraries
and
the
internet
is
|||
secret
information
|||
thus
an
appeal
to
secrecy
would
not
provide
|||
grounds
for
repatriating
information
|||
harmful
material
|||
in
addition
to
intellectual
property
and
secrecy
limitations
on
access
|||
to
information
u
|||
s
|||
law
also
has
provisions
to
limit
peoples
access
|||
to
harmful
information
|||
information
may
be
harmful
in
the
sense
|||
that
a
person
can
use
the
information
to
engage
in
harmful
activities
|||
so
for
example
we
might
limit
peoples
access
to
information
about
|||
the
security
plans
of
a
power
plant
or
town
reservoir
|||
information
may
|||
be
considered
harmful
in
the
sense
that
it
is
harmful
for
people
to
be
|||
exposed
to
certain
information
|||
so
for
example
there
are
limitations
|||
on
how
much
graphic
violence
can
be
shown
on
broadcast
television
|||
the
|||
idea
is
that
it
can
be
upsetting
to
people
to
be
unwittingly
exposed
to
|||
such
material
|||
and
some
may
even
think
that
information
may
be
harmful
|||
to
some
children
but
not
necessarily
harmful
to
others
adults
|||
thus
the
law
limits
childrens
access
to
certain
sorts
of
explicit
|||
sexual
material
while
not
limiting
adults
access
to
such
material
|||
it
may
be
argued
that
certain
indigenous
cultural
information
can
be
|||
harmful
if
accessed
by
the
wrong
person
in
the
wrong
way
|||
while
|||
arguments
that
information
may
be
harmful
are
frequently
a
subject
of
|||
quite
strong
disagreement
and
debate
decisions
about
whether
material
|||
may
be
restricted
due
to
putative
harm
is
standardly
determined
through
|||
democratic
processes
as
constrained
by
the
constitution
|||
it
is
very
|||
possible
that
nonindigenous
persons
will
not
share
the
views
of
|||
indigenous
persons
about
the
harm
that
could
result
from
exposure
to
|||
songs
images
or
information
about
religious
practices
|||
in
other
|||
words
the
harm
justification
is
unlikely
to
gain
an
overlapping
|||
consensus
|||
privacy
and
confidentiality
|||
the
final
justification
for
limiting
access
to
information
is
based
on
|||
claims
of
privacy
or
confidentiality
|||
informational
privacy
concerns
|||
information
about
persons
which
is
considered
sensitive
|||
according
to
ronald
standler
for
example
privacy
is
the
|||
expectation
that
confidential
personal
information
disclosed
in
a
|||
private
place
will
not
be
disclosed
to
third
parties
when
that
|||
disclosure
would
cause
either
embarrassment
or
emotional
distress
to
a
|||
person
of
reasonable
sensitivities
|||
information
is
interpreted
broadly
|||
to
include
facts
images
e
|||
g
|||
photographs
videotapes
and
|||
disparaging
opinions
|||
on
the
face
of
it
privacy
may
seem
to
be
the
least
likely
candidate
for
|||
grounding
indigenous
peoples
rights
to
cultural
information
|||
one
|||
tends
to
think
of
privacy
as
essentially
an
individual
right
|||
indeed
a
|||
number
of
authors
have
specifically
characterized
the
right
of
privacy
|||
as
the
right
to
be
let
alone
|||
and
the
supreme
court
in
|||
rejecting
the
claim
of
a
corporate
right
to
privacy
held
that
|||
corporations
can
claim
no
equality
with
individuals
in
the
enjoyment
|||
of
a
right
to
privacy
|||
indeed
some
have
actually
characterized
|||
a
right
to
privacy
as
a
right
to
individuality
|||
this
seems
on
the
|||
face
of
it
to
exclude
groups
such
as
tribes
or
clans
from
defending
|||
their
claim
to
their
cultural
information
as
a
type
of
right
to
privacy
|||
however
i
want
to
argue
that
indeed
there
is
a
notion
of
group
privacy
|||
and
that
it
can
provide
the
best
grounds
for
indigenous
peoples
rights
|||
to
limit
access
to
their
cultural
information
|||
the
value
of
the
right
|||
to
group
privacyto
control
what
information
those
outside
of
the
|||
group
have
about
the
groupis
essentially
the
same
value
as
individual
|||
privacy
|||
we
can
find
three
accounts
of
the
underlying
values
that
a
|||
privacy
right
serves
in
the
literature
on
privacy
|||
we
can
call
these
|||
strands
the
consequentialist
the
kantian
liberal
and
the
communitarian
|||
views
|||
all
of
these
views
provide
support
for
a
group
right
to
privacy
|||
in
cultural
information
|||
consequentialist
defense
of
group
privacy
|||
on
the
consequentialist
view
the
value
of
privacy
is
that
it
allows
us
|||
to
gain
certain
benefits
and
avoid
certain
harms
|||
posner
discusses
this
|||
feature
of
privacy
in
an
article
that
in
general
is
skeptical
about
the
|||
value
of
privacy
|||
he
argues
that
certain
sorts
of
goodse
|||
g
|||
those
that
require
confidentiality
could
not
be
enjoyed
without
|||
privacy
|||
some
argue
that
the
fact
that
people
find
invasions
of
privacy
|||
personally
distressing
provides
at
least
some
moral
grounds
for
|||
preventing
and
avoiding
such
invasions
|||
it
is
obvious
that
the
groups
ability
to
control
access
to
their
|||
cultural
information
will
often
have
good
consequences
|||
first
in
line
|||
with
posners
argument
it
will
make
them
more
willing
to
share
|||
information
among
themselves
and
with
outsiders
if
they
know
that
they
|||
can
control
the
extent
to
which
such
information
is
disseminated
|||
this
|||
is
valuable
for
the
ability
of
the
group
to
have
a
rich
culture
and
|||
allows
a
freer
flow
of
information
to
the
outside
|||
if
the
group
has
no
|||
ability
to
control
the
dissemination
of
information
about
their
culture
|||
they
may
be
less
likely
to
share
such
information
for
fear
that
it
will
|||
leak
out
into
the
public
domain
|||
second
it
is
clear
that
many
|||
indigenous
peoples
find
it
distressing
for
outsiders
to
know
about
|||
publicly
display
etc
|||
cultural
information
|||
thus
limiting
others
|||
ability
to
do
this
will
avoid
the
bad
consequences
of
this
distress
|||
kantian
liberal
defense
of
group
privacy
|||
the
kantian
liberal
view
holds
that
privacy
is
essential
to
human
|||
dignity
|||
in
particular
it
is
argued
that
privacy
provides
a
sphere
of
|||
autonomy
for
individuals
which
is
necessary
for
them
to
live
|||
authentically
human
lives
|||
if
others
can
use
personal
information
|||
about
me
for
their
own
ends
they
fail
to
treat
me
with
dignity
as
a
|||
human
being
|||
and
if
others
can
observe
me
without
my
|||
permission
they
interfere
with
my
ability
to
make
my
own
choices
free
|||
from
external
scrutiny
|||
i
call
this
view
the
kantian
liberal
view
of
|||
privacy
because
its
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
individual
|||
autonomy
is
clearly
inspired
by
kants
idea
that
persons
are
|||
fundamentally
rational
beings
capable
of
choice
and
his
categorical
|||
imperative
that
persons
ought
not
be
treated
as
a
means
|||
it
is
liberal
|||
insofar
as
it
focuses
on
the
liberty
of
the
individual
and
the
|||
fundamental
grounds
of
our
capacity
for
individuality
and
individual
|||
expression
|||
it
is
not
only
individuals
but
also
groups
that
may
be
|||
autonomous
|||
we
can
call
this
collective
autonomy
|||
collective
autonomy
is
closely
tied
to
the
concepts
of
|||
selfdetermination
and
sovereignty
|||
in
order
to
have
collective
|||
autonomy
we
may
argue
that
a
group
needs
what
loretta
todd
has
called
|||
cultural
autonomy
|||
according
to
todd
cultural
autonomy
|||
signifies
a
right
to
ones
origins
and
histories
as
told
from
|||
within
the
culture
and
not
as
mediated
from
without
|||
this
right
|||
to
cultural
autonomy
is
violated
when
others
appropriate
cultural
|||
information
|||
as
todd
describes
it
appropriation
occurs
when
someone
|||
else
speaks
for
tells
defines
describes
represents
uses
or
|||
recruits
the
images
stories
experiences
dreams
of
others
for
their
|||
own
|||
this
idea
is
closely
tied
to
the
argument
that
bloustein
|||
makes
that
personal
dignity
is
harmed
when
persons
are
used
as
a
|||
means
to
others
entertainment
curiousity
or
economic
gain
|||
in
|||
such
a
case
a
persons
dignity
and
ability
to
control
his
own
|||
lifeby
having
control
over
his
identity
are
harmed
|||
in
a
similar
|||
way
a
group
that
cannot
have
some
control
over
how
its
identity
as
|||
defined
when
its
culture
is
used
exploited
is
treated
as
a
means
|||
rather
than
as
an
end
in
itself
|||
communitarian
defense
of
group
privacy
|||
the
communitarian
view
of
the
value
of
privacy
holds
that
privacy
is
|||
essential
to
us
as
social
beings
|||
in
particular
it
allows
us
|||
to
modulate
how
much
and
what
type
of
information
that
others
have
about
|||
us
|||
this
allows
us
to
form
intimate
relationships
by
selectively
|||
revealing
private
information
to
some
persons
|||
according
to
charles
|||
fried
for
example
intimacy
requires
that
we
have
the
ability
to
reveal
|||
information
about
ourselves
which
we
do
not
reveal
to
all
|||
privacy
is
|||
thus
a
means
to
modulate
degrees
of
friendship
privacy
|||
provides
freedom
to
define
ourselves
in
relation
to
others
by
not
|||
revealing
our
every
thought
|||
the
communitarian
argument
can
also
be
marshaled
to
defend
a
group
right
|||
to
privacy
|||
group
privacy
is
important
for
both
the
capacity
for
|||
members
within
the
group
to
form
relationships
and
engage
in
various
|||
social
and
cultural
activities
and
to
modulate
their
relationships
with
|||
external
individuals
and
groups
|||
the
connection
between
privacy
and
|||
the
ability
to
form
relationships
can
also
be
seen
in
the
case
of
group
|||
privacy
|||
group
privacy
is
necessary
for
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
|||
both
internal
relationships
among
the
members
of
a
group
and
external
|||
relationships
between
the
group
and
other
groups
or
individual
nongroup
|||
members
|||
indeed
gerstein
specifically
makes
this
connection
in
his
|||
discussion
of
privacy
|||
he
notes
that
from
within
the
experience
of
|||
a
religious
ceremony
its
significance
depends
on
its
religious
meaning
|||
for
the
participants
|||
this
means
that
there
will
always
be
the
|||
threat
of
the
degeneration
of
the
religious
act
into
a
mere
form
a
|||
hollow
shell
with
nothing
but
its
surface
attractiveness
to
give
it
|||
value
|||
again
the
need
to
deal
with
this
threat
from
within
makes
it
|||
necessary
to
resist
observation
from
without
|||
the
presence
of
the
|||
onlooker
if
it
is
not
met
with
resistance
makes
those
involved
in
the
|||
ceremony
accomplices
in
a
concentration
on
the
surface
of
things
at
|||
expense
of
inner
meaning
|||
he
argues
that
even
if
ones
|||
actions
are
motivated
by
noble
goals
they
can
be
destructive
to
the
|||
meaning
of
the
act
for
the
participant
|||
he
may
well
|||
feel
as
sense
of
desecration
whenever
what
was
to
function
purely
as
|||
part
of
the
expression
of
a
relationship
between
himself
and
his
god
is
|||
made
use
of
by
otherseven
as
a
means
of
learning
about
that
|||
relationship
|||
limitations
on
group
privacy
|||
if
we
accept
the
idea
that
indigenous
groups
have
a
right
to
cultural
|||
privacy
which
places
a
duty
on
states
and
individuals
to
limit
access
|||
to
certain
sorts
of
cultural
information
|||
we
are
still
faced
with
an
|||
important
question
|||
why
do
indigenous
peoples
in
particular
have
a
|||
right
to
cultural
privacy
what
about
other
groups
such
as
|||
scientology
the
catholic
church
the
american
library
association
the
|||
amish
do
they
also
have
rights
to
cultural
privacy
that
we
have
a
duty
|||
to
respect
|||
there
are
a
number
of
features
of
the
case
of
indigenous
peoples
that
|||
make
their
claim
to
cultural
privacy
much
stronger
|||
first
recall
that
|||
the
function
of
privacy
protections
is
to
protect
and
enhance
autonomy
|||
individual
or
collective
and
to
preserve
individuality
personal
or
|||
cultural
|||
some
sorts
of
entities
have
a
greater
claim
to
autonomy
|||
promoting
protections
than
othersadults
more
than
children
humans
|||
more
than
animals
|||
interestingly
it
is
because
some
entities
have
a
|||
greater
capacity
for
autonomy
and
a
greater
need
for
it
that
we
are
more
|||
concerned
to
promote
it
|||
some
groups
have
a
greater
capacity
and
need
|||
for
autonomy
than
others
|||
the
more
comprehensive
a
group
isthe
|||
more
aspects
of
life
it
encompasses
the
greater
its
capacity
and
need
|||
for
autonomy
or
selfrule
|||
indigenous
groups
often
encompass
|||
multiple
aspects
of
their
members
livesspiritual
physical
|||
educational
political
etc
|||
other
groups
such
as
the
american
library
|||
association
for
instance
do
not
have
this
sort
of
comprehensive
|||
character
|||
the
ala
only
encompasses
the
professional
lives
of
its
|||
members
|||
typically
members
will
belong
to
many
other
sorts
of
groups
|||
which
will
encompass
other
parts
of
their
livesfamily
religion
|||
political
party
ethnic
group
|||
given
this
the
ala
has
both
less
of
a
|||
capacity
to
be
fully
an
autonomous
group
and
it
has
less
of
an
important
|||
role
in
the
lives
of
its
members
|||
thus
such
comprehensive
communities
|||
as
indigenous
peoples
will
require
greater
autonomy
thus
will
have
a
|||
stronger
claim
to
informational
privacy
|||
secondly
it
may
be
that
there
are
certain
contextual
features
of
some
|||
groups
that
provide
grounds
for
greater
informational
privacy
|||
protections
|||
two
dimensions
of
the
context
of
indigenous
peoples
give
|||
them
greater
claim
to
cultural
privacy
than
many
other
groups
their
|||
current
context
and
the
historical
context
of
genocide
forced
|||
assimilation
and
cultural
appropriation
|||
in
the
current
national
and
|||
international
context
many
indigenous
peoples
are
parts
of
larger
states
|||
or
cultural
groups
that
are
both
culturally
different
and
culturally
|||
dominant
there
is
a
greater
need
for
that
groups
culture
to
be
|||
protected
|||
the
case
of
indigenous
peoples
indeed
is
of
particular
|||
note
because
they
face
not
just
neglect
discrimination
and
swamping
|||
by
the
majority
culture
but
the
active
appropriation
and
exploitation
|||
by
the
majority
culture
|||
many
within
majority
cultures
do
not
just
|||
neglect
the
cultures
of
indigenous
peoples
but
try
to
attain
some
sort
|||
of
false
authenticity
through
acts
of
appropriation
|||
such
acts
of
|||
appropriation
are
often
also
commercializing
and
imply
that
the
cultures
|||
are
dead
or
something
of
the
past
rather
than
living
cultures
|||
within
which
people
find
meaning
and
live
their
lives
|||
this
|||
appropriation
threatens
the
meanings
of
the
culture
for
those
who
live
|||
within
it
|||
this
is
a
sort
of
threat
that
is
not
faced
by
such
groups
as
|||
those
listed
above
|||
given
that
the
last
two
reasons
for
supporting
a
duty
to
respect
the
|||
right
to
cultural
privacy
on
the
part
of
indigenous
peoples
are
heavily
|||
contextual
it
may
be
that
such
rights
and
the
concomitant
duties
are
|||
remedial
rather
than
eternal
|||
while
the
concept
of
cultural
privacy
is
|||
important
it
may
be
that
the
values
of
free
flow
of
information
are
|||
sufficiently
important
that
when
a
group
is
culturally
strong
we
should
|||
strike
a
different
balance
from
the
one
we
strike
when
the
group
had
not
|||
had
the
power
to
use
normal
means
to
protect
its
culture
in
the
past
|||
there
are
however
important
limits
to
the
rights
of
cultural
privacy
|||
it
is
important
to
note
that
indigenous
groups
do
not
exist
in
a
realm
|||
separate
from
other
groups
and
individuals
thus
it
is
neither
possible
|||
nor
feasible
that
they
have
absolute
privacy
|||
what
they
do
|||
affects
others
and
insofar
as
they
engage
with
others
there
needs
to
be
|||
some
degree
of
transparency
in
their
interactions
and
they
need
to
be
|||
open
to
discussion
and
criticism
|||
in
particular
it
is
important
that
we
address
concerns
that
privacy
|||
claims
may
be
used
to
cover
up
corruption
abuses
of
power
deception
|||
etc
|||
as
judith
decew
has
pointed
out
privacy
appears
to
be
|||
something
we
value
to
provide
a
sphere
within
which
we
can
be
free
from
|||
interference
by
others
and
yet
it
also
appears
to
function
negatively
|||
as
the
cloak
under
which
one
can
hide
domination
degradation
or
|||
physical
harm
to
women
and
others
|||
privacy
claims
may
be
used
to
|||
block
any
public
criticism
by
arguing
that
the
criticism
includes
|||
private
information
about
the
group
|||
given
this
it
will
be
|||
important
to
carve
out
room
for
a
kind
of
whistle
blower
exception
to
|||
the
rights
of
groups
to
protect
their
cultural
privacy
|||
finally
the
right
of
group
privacy
should
not
be
understood
as
|||
absolute
|||
there
are
other
rights
of
individuals
as
human
beingsas
|||
encoded
in
the
u
|||
n
|||
declaration
of
human
rights
with
which
these
group
|||
rights
must
be
balanced
|||
thus
if
some
practice
is
abusive
of
|||
individual
persons
the
right
that
the
group
has
to
privacy
is
|||
overridden
|||
of
course
some
may
object
to
any
restriction
on
the
|||
grounds
that
any
outside
interference
will
be
tantamount
to
|||
imperialistically
imposing
values
|||
however
the
presumption
of
this
|||
paper
is
that
there
are
some
shared
values
to
which
we
may
agree
|||
and
|||
insofar
as
the
indigenous
peoples
points
of
view
are
represented
in
|||
the
undir
they
are
committed
to
the
provisions
of
the
u
|||
n
|||
human
rights
|||
document
|||
it
is
the
view
expressed
in
undir
that
there
is
no
|||
contradiction
between
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
and
the
|||
individual
rights
as
expressed
in
