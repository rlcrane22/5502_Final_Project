abstract
|||
in
this
paper
we
examine
transformations
that
have
taken
place
in
|||
eresearch
and
address
the
potential
for
additional
|||
transformations
as
eresearch
develops
and
matures
|||
the
notion
|||
of
a
transformation
in
eresearch
can
operate
on
many
levels
|||
transformations
in
the
tools
used
to
conduct
research
|||
transformations
in
projects
that
enable
new
types
of

to

in

the
types
of
scientific
questions
that
can
be
asked
and
able
to
be

asked
and
transformations
in
the
scientific
imagination
|||
while
|||
much
of
the
current
rhetoric
implies
that
eresearch
will
|||
transform
the
very
nature
of
science
other
types
of
lesspervasive
|||
transformations
are
more
evident
at
these
relatively
early
stages
in
|||
the
development
of
eresearch
infrastructures
and
some
evidence
|||
supports
the
idea
that
continuity
has
been
more
common
in
the
|||
ordinary
scientific
practice
of
eresearch
rather
than
|||
transformation

to
act
as
the

|||
to
do
this
a

central
hub
was
established
at
the
university
of
manchester
and
|||
eight
individual
nodes
were
funded
in
for
an
initial
three
|||
year
period
ncess
also
funded
twelve
smaller
pilot
projects
that
|||
ran
for
short
periods
ranging
from
months
|||
in
a
|||
second
round
of
threeyear
funding
was
announced
which
|||
included
continuing
support
for
the
oess
node
through

seven
of
the
initial
nodes
are
primarily
concerned
with
creating
|||
demonstrator
projects
which
show
the
potential
of
esocial
|||
science
in
a
variety
of
domains
|||
the
oess
node
is
somewhat
|||
different
than
the
others
rather
than
creating
software
tools
to
|||
enable
esocial
science
the
oess
node
studies
the
social
shaping
|||
of
eresearch
|||
in
particular
it
focuses
on
the
social
institutional
|||
legal
and
ethical
contexts
that
shape
the
development
and
|||
adoption
of
new
technologies
|||
it
does
this
work
by
examining
|||
how
various
escience
and
esocial
science
projects
develop
and
|||
change
over
time
including
cases
drawn
from
the
other
ncess

and
cases
from

oess
cases
and
themes
|||
the
oess
project
is
currently
in
the
process
of
conducting
|||
ongoing
case
studies
in
several
eresearch
domains
|||
each
of
the
|||
case
studies
involves
examining
one
or
more
specific
projects
|||
engaged
in
developing
tools
to
enable
eresearch
in
a
specific
|||
domain
and
each
of
these
cases
also
contributes
to
the
|||
investigation
of
a
number
of
themes
in
specific
areas
including
|||
ethics
and
trust
intellectual
property
openness
of
access
and
|||
disciplinarity
|||
an
attempt
is
also
made
to
distribute
the
cases
|||
across
a
wide
range
in
social
science
this
includes
qualitative
|||
social
science
quantitative
social
science
geospatial
modelling

and

and

|||
the
|||
methods
for
this
research
are
a
mix
of
qualitative
and
quantitative
|||
methods
including
interviews
both
with
project
personnel
and
the
|||
users
of
their
scientific
tools
observation
of
how
the
tools
are

implemented
analysis
of

and
a

quantitative
survey
of

social
scientists
about
their
use
of
esocial
science
tools
and
their
attitudes
toward
esocial
science
in

general
|||
while
these
case
studies
are
still
ongoing
in
this
paper
we
will
|||
describe
an
illustrative
case
and
discuss
examples
of
some
of
the

crosscutting
issues
and
themes
that
are
emerging
across
a
variety

of
cases

finally
we
will
draw
some
initial
conclusions
about

where
mike

is
the

central

focus
is
making

the
fast

easy
creation
of

elements
for

one

example
of
the

is
the
virtual

demonstrator

see
figure
which
offered
users
a
virtual
flythrough
of
|||
london
using
the
google
earth
viewer
as
a
platform
|||
when
geovue
created
virtual
london
the
target
audience
they
|||
had
in
mind
was
primarily
urban
planners
and
policy
makers
|||
virtual
london
was
designed
not
only
to
create
a
useful
dimension
map
of
london
but
also
to
allow
overlaying
data
|||
for
|||
example
local
governments
could
overlay
pollution
readings
and
|||
visualize
areas
where
pollution
abatement
measures
are
most
|||
needed
|||
once
the
application
was
completed
the
project
attracted
|||
the
attention
of
google
who
expressed
an
interest
in
including
it
|||
in
the
google
earth
viewer
so
that
users
anywhere
could
have
|||
access
to
virtual
london
|||
it
is
at
this
point
in
the
story
that
institutional
and
legal
|||
arrangements
intervened
and
prevented
the
public
release
of
|||
virtual
london
|||
the
virtual
london
application
while
it
was
|||
built
in
the
google
earth
viewer
relied
on
the
ordnance
surveys
|||
mastermap
data
to
build
the
d
projections
of
buildings
|||
ordnance
survey
is
the
national
agency
of
the
british
government
|||
that
is
responsible
for
the
official
definitive
surveying
and
|||
topographic
mapping
of
great
britain
|||
in
order
to
include
|||
virtual
london
in
google
earth
google
would
have
had
to
|||
obtain
permission
to
use
the
ordnance
survey
data
underlying
the
|||
application
|||
ordnance
survey
data
however
is
protected
by

crown
copyright
which
covers
all
works
made
by
an
officer
or
|||
servant
of
the
crown
in
the
course
of
his
duties
|||
this
is
in
|||
sharp
contrast
to
the
situation
in
the
united
states
where
|||
copyright
protection
is
not
available
for
any
work
of
the
|||
united
states
government
|||
because
works
created
by

federal
agencies
are
not
subject
to
copyright
protection
in
the
|||
u
|||
s
|||
data
created
can
be
used
by
individuals
and
by
organizations
|||
wishing
to
put
it
to
use
|||
in
the
u
|||
k
|||
that
is
not
the
case
the
|||
ordnance
survey
data
must
be
licensed
for
use
|||
in
the
case
of
virtual
london
google
was
willing
to
pay
for
a
|||
license
and
indicated
that
the
actual
amount
wasnt
really
too
|||
much
of
a
concern
|||
according
to
a
geovue
staff
member
|||
google
were
willing
to
pay
whatever
it
took
yeah
|||
that
was
the
|||
whole
point
|||
they
would
pay
whatever
ordnance
survey
said
|||
but
ordnance
survey
wouldnt
budge
for
any
price
interview
|||
oct
|||
the
only
possible
price
the
ordnance
survey
was
|||
able
to
offer
was
|||
per
click
which
was
not
possible
in
|||
google
earth
where
this
type
of
clicking
is
not
part
of
the
|||
interface
|||
in
google
earth
the
user
zooms
and
flies
virtually
|||
through
the
space
|||
neither
ordnance
survey
nor
google
were
|||
able
to
suggest
an
equitable
way
of
measuring
the
uses
of
virtual
|||
london
|||
even
though
later
discussions
took
place
among
|||
geovue
google
and
the
ordnance
survey
in
january
a
|||
member
of
the
geovue
project
team
indicated
that
he
had
given
|||
up
on
holding
out
much
hope
for
getting
virtual
london
released
|||
and
had
moved
on
to
other
projects
personal
conversation
jan
|||
it
can
be
added
that
throughout
the
duration
of
the
project
|||
there
was
a
high
profile
campaign
led
by
the
guardian
newspaper
|||
to
open
access
to
the
ordnance
survey
and
other
government
|||
data
a
campaign
which
is
still
ongoing
|||
in
other
words
the
issue
|||
of
ordnance
survey
access
was
not
limited
to
the
geovue
|||
project
but
part
of
a
wider
debate
in
the
uk
|||
this
case
is
a
clear
illustration
of
the
legal
and
institutional
issues
|||
that
can
erect
barriers
to
sharing
data
and
implementing
eresearch
projects
|||
it
is
often
assumed
that
many
projects
fail
to
|||
figure
virtual

uktechnologyfreeourdata
|||
achieve
their
goals
because
of
technical
barriers
to
|||
implementation
|||
in
the
case
of
geovue
however
the
geovue
|||
team
had
successfully
removed
the
technical
barriers
and
had
|||
built
a
functioning
effective
application
with
the
potential
to
have
|||
an
impact
on
public
policy
and
academic
research
|||
legal
and
|||
institutional
arrangements
however
prevented
virtual
london
|||
from
being
released
widely
|||
the
legal
issues
are
based
on
|||
national
copyright
requirements
as
discussed
above
|||
them
through
their
organization
they
would
have
faced
too
great
a
|||
hurdle
and
often
decided
to
do
without
the
visualization
|||
component
in
their
research
|||
geovue
and
another
ncess
node
|||
moses
both
have
been
working
to
make
the
creation
of
map
data
|||
much
more
transparent
to
the
average
scientist
in
doing
so
they
|||
hope
to
transform
the
way
social
scientists
see
their
data
|||
this
|||
potential
transformation
may
be
quite
powerful
and
the
oess
|||
project
will
continue
to
follow
developments
in
this
area
|||
institutional
arrangements
also
came
into
play
however
|||
when
|||
geovue
and
google
approached
the
ordnance
survey
for
|||
permission
to
use
the
ordnance
survey
data
that
was
used
to
|||
generate
virtual
london
they
ran
into
considerable
institutional
|||
indifference
above
and
beyond
the
legal
barriers
|||
in
other
words
|||
geovue
felt
that
not
only
was
there
an
issue
surrounding
|||
copyright
and
payment
for
licensing
but
also
a
feeling
that
|||
ordnance
survey
just
didnt
think
that
such
an
application
was
of
|||
any
interest
to
them
|||
this
became
even
clearer
to
geovue
project
|||
members
after
they
set
up
a
sample
virtual
london
in
their
space
|||
on
second
nature
island
in
the
second
life
virtual
world
|||
geovue
felt
that
the
second
life
virtual
london
demonstrator
|||
would
be
seen
as
a
feather
in
the
cap
of
the
ordnance
survey
|||
which
was
clearly
identified
as
a
source
of
data
|||
the
data
was
not
|||
exposed
in
the
demonstrator
so
it
was
not
making
it
possible
for
|||
nonlicensed
users
to
obtain
protected
data
and
geovue
felt
|||
ordnance
survey
could
use
second
life
virtual
london
to
show
|||
people
how
their
data
could
be
used
|||
they
were
taken
aback
then
|||
when
the
ordnance
survey
response
was
a
demand
to
|||
immediately
remove
the
demonstrator
or
risk
legal
action
|||
they
|||
had
no
choice
but
to
remove
it
and
replaced
virtual
london
with
|||
another
demonstrator
virtual
phuket
|||
crosscutting
themes
and
issues
|||
in
this
case
several
institutional
and
disciplinary
contexts
came
|||
into
conflict
|||
geovue
is
comprised
of
academic
geographers
and
|||
computer
programmers
|||
like
most
other
academics
the
notion
of
|||
sharing
ones
results
and
publishing
ones
output
without
|||
expectation
of
direct
financial
reward
is
part
of
their
institutional
|||
and
cultural
expectations
|||
they
may
also
have
been
somewhat
|||
nave
about
the
legal
issues
involved
as
the
team
did
not
include
|||
lawyers
or
copyright
experts
|||
there
would
have
been
little
reason
|||
to
expect
to
need
to
include
such
experts
when
the
initial
plan
|||
was
to
figure
out
ways
to
combine
computer
programming
power
|||
with
questions
of
interest
to
geographers
government
planners
|||
and
other
academics
|||
this
lack
of
expertise
however
resulted
in
|||
being
caught
unaware
when
they
came
up
against
the
government
|||
bureaucrats
and
lawyers
working
for
ordnance
survey
|||
googles
|||
institutional
culture
as
an
american
corporation
also
had
an
|||
effect
googles
response
was
fairly
typical
of
the
stereotype
of
|||
americans
to
simply
assume
that
throwing
enough
money
at
the
|||
problem
would
cause
it
to
go
away
|||
while
this
case
illustrates
a
constraint
imposed
by
legal
and
|||
institutional
considerations
it
nevertheless
also
shows
some
of
the
|||
promise
of
transformation
that
projects
such
as
geovue
offer
to
|||
social
scientists
|||
in
the
past
the
use
of
geospatial
information
has
|||
been
relatively
limited
because
of
the
technical
complexity
of
|||
working
with
map
data
and
gis
programs
|||
recently
however
|||
and
especially
with
the
advent
of
the
web
there
has
been
a
surge
|||
of
interest
in
digital
mapping
techniques
and
combining
these
|||
with
different
types
of
data
and
information
|||
for
many
social
|||
scientists
who
wanted
to
include
geospatial
analysis
and
data
|||
presentation
unless
they
had
a
gis
expert
on
staff
or
available
to
|||
the
case
studies
in
the
oess
project
are
designed
not
only
to
|||
illustrate
particular
cases
of
interest
but
also
to
illuminate
our
|||
understanding
of
a
variety
of
themes
and
issues
that
have
emerged
|||
during
the
first
phase
of
the
research
|||
these
themes
and
issues
|||
are
threads
that
run
throughout
the
work
and
help
describe
how
eresearch
is
undergoing
social
shaping
at
this
relatively
early
point
|||
in
the
development
of
many
eresearch
projects
|||
among
the
|||
important
themes
are
trust
privacy
disciplinarity
and
openness
|||
a
number
of
other
issues
are
not
properly
called
themes
per
se
|||
but
also
represent
important
issues
that
occur
in
a
variety
of
|||
projects
|||
these
issues
include
the
difficulty
of
sharing
data
the
|||
limitations
of
geography
economic
constraints
shifts
in
funding
|||
models
and
ways
of
approaching
new
scientific
questions
|||
in
the
|||
interests
of
limited
space
we
will
touch
on
several
of
these
only
|||
briefly
here
|||
challenges
for
eresearch
|||
data
sharing
|||
data
sharing
has
proven
to
be
a
significant
challenge
for
many
|||
efforts
at
building
collaborative
infrastructures
for
research
|||
beyond
legal
and
institutional
barriers
to
sharing
data
such
as
the
|||
geovue
case
described
above
there
are
a
variety
of
other
issues
|||
that
arise
as
researchers
contemplate
sharing
data
|||
oess
project
|||
members
carusi
and
jirotka
for
instance
have
published
work
|||
discussing
how
a
seemingly
simple
data
archive
can
become
an
|||
ethical
labrynth
|||
digital
archives
they
argue
can
help
|||
normalize
scientific
research
by
increasing
accessibility
|||
uniformity
and
transparency
|||
archived
data
can
also
help
|||
scientists
avoid
needless
repetition
and
enable
secondary
uses
of
|||
data
|||
however
in
practice
much
social
science
data
resists
|||
archiving
particularly
qualitative
research
data
|||
issues
such
as
|||
guarding
subject
privacy
through
anonymization
can
render
|||
otherwise
rich
data
essentially
meaningless
as
important
|||
relationships
are
stripped
from
sanitized
data
|||
other
contextual
|||
information
may
not
be
apparent
in
the
data
and
secondary
|||
researchers
may
mischaracterize
data
in
ways
that
the
original
|||
researchers
who
were
embedded
in
the
social
relationships
under
|||
study
would
not
do
|||
reusing
data
for
purposes
beyond
those
|||
initially
stated
also
has
implications
not
only
with
regard
to
|||
informed
consent
agreements
but
also
run
the
risk
of
jeopardizing
|||
the
relationship
between
the
original
researcher
and
their
subjects
|||
if
the
subjects
feel
misled
or
duped
by
the
subsequent
uses
|||
the
geovue
and
moses
nodes
of
ncess
have
merged
their
|||
efforts
for
phase
funding
|||
this
will
also
necessitate
some
|||
transformations
in
work
practices
as
the
two
nodes
are
located
in
|||
different
cities
and
have
been
targeting
somewhat
different
|||
audiences
to
this
point
|||
another
major
issue
standing
in
the
way
of
widespread
data
|||
sharing
is
the
unresolved
issue
of
how
academic
researchers
can
|||
be
assigned
credit
and
rewards
for
contributing
scientific
data
to
a
|||
public
archive
|||
the
reward
structure
of
academia
currently
|||
favours
publication
in
top
peerreviewed
journals
and
|||
subsequently
having
ones
work
cited
by
other
peerreviewed
|||
articles
|||
most
measures
of
academic
quality
offer
no
credit
for
|||
having
created
a
dataset
that
other
researchers
use
or
for
creating
|||
a
software
package
that
enables
research
|||
indexing
services
such
|||
as
the
web
of
knowledge
do
not
index
databases
|||
the
promise
of
|||
eresearch
in
this
area
represents
a
potentially
major
|||
transformation
in
scholarly
practice
should
the
publication
of
|||
scientific
data
become
a
standard
part
of
the
scientometric
|||
measures
that
measure
scientific
impact
and
are
often
used
in
the
|||
evaluation
of
researchers
departments
and
organizations
see
|||
also
|||
some
efforts
are
being
made
to
address
this
issue
of
academic
|||
credit
for
data
sharing
|||
oess
researcher
meyer
has
studied
an
|||
american
biomedical
project
dealing
with
issues
of
sharing
data
|||
the
genetic

a

partnership
that
offered
academic

researchers
highquality

an
order
of
magnitude
more

detailed
than
they
had
previously
used
in
exchange
for
releasing

their
data
and
blood

for
other
researchers
and
private

organizations
such
as

the

distribution
for

is
being
implemented
in
a

called

the

of

begin
to
have
a
way
to
demonstrate
the
impact

of
their
work
creating
the

while
the
wellknown

framingham
study
certainly
has
many
other
indicators
of
success

available
to
them
as
well
other
less
wellknown
studies
can
track

who
is
using
their
data
often
for
the
first
time

while
some
of

these
datasets
may
have
been
shared
and
distributed
on
an
ad
hoc
|||
basis
in
the
past
without
a
central
resource
to
track
data
uses
|||
knowing
how
ones
data
is
used
can
be
difficult
or
impossible
|||
furthermore
until
resources
are
made
available
for
professional
|||
management
of
such
resources
most
datasets
will
continue
to
|||
remain
scattered
across
individual
researchers
hard
drives
and
|||
local
networks
|||
again
we
see
a
potential
for
transformation
in
scientific
practice
|||
here
one
that
is
closer
to
realization
through
the
combination
of
|||
technological
enablers
the
dbgap
website
scholarly
incentives
|||
access
to
additional
data
and
economic
incentives
access
to
|||
additional
future
funding
for
scientific
work
|||
escience
as
open
science
|||
another
theme
of
the
oess
project
has
been
the
openness
or
|||
otherwise
of
eresearch
|||
one
of
the
promises
of
eresearch
has
|||
been
that
it
should
enhance
open
access
to
knowledge
and
thus
to
|||
reconfigure
access
to
knowledge
in
terms
of
allowing
data
|||
and
resources
from
eresearch
to
be
shared
and
disseminated
|||
more
freely
with
fewer
restrictions
for
example
by
means
of
|||
copyrights
and
patents
and
perhaps
using
open
source
licensing
|||
or
similar
|||
there
has
been
widespread
support
from
funding
|||
bodies
researchers
science
policymaking
bodies
and
nongovernmental
organizations
for
open
science
and
open
access
|||
policies
and
practices
but
there
has
also
been
evidence
of
|||
resistance
from
stakeholders
such
as
publishers
who
do
not
want
|||
published
material
made
available
freely
online
and
researchers
|||
who
do
not
want
deposit
their
data
immediately
to
share
it
with
|||
others
|||
on
closer
inspection
then
the
openness
of
eresearch
|||
widely
espoused
as
an
aim
needs
to
be
disaggregated
and
its
|||
potential
and
implementation
in
practice
evaluated
in
a
way
that
|||
goes
beyond
the
general
principle
|||
to
do
this
we
can
take
first
the
most
macrolevel
of
eresearch
|||
the
infrastructures
that
eresearch
is
in
the
process
of
|||
developing
|||
on
this
level
an
attempt
is
being
made
to
create
|||
shared
sets
of
tools
and
resources
for
researchers
in
and
across
|||
certain
disciplines
that
are
akin
to
the
social
infrastructures
|||
transport
communication
that
have
been
created
to
support
|||
social
development
|||
this
trend
is
particularly
clear
in
the
us
|||
where
the
term
cyberinfrastructure
is
widely
used
to
describe
|||
developments
in
eresearch
|||
here
the
support
of
science
policy
|||
makers
and
funding
bodies
has
been
critical
and
much
of
the
|||
effort
of
national
and
international
eresearch
programmes
has
|||
been
devoted
to
infrastructure
development
|||
the
efforts
to
make
|||
these
infrastructures
open
however
must
be
put
into
an
even
|||
larger
context
of
current
conflicts
over
intellectual
property
|||
regimes
and
the
forces
that
are
aligned
to
change
them
towards
|||
greater
openness
or
to
maintain
the
existing
regimes
of
|||
restrictions
and
access
rights
|||
these
include
commercial
interests
|||
ngos
and
policy
makers
and
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
the
|||
current
interplay
of
forces
will
shift
the
momentum
of
|||
infrastructural
systems
in
one
or
other
direction
|||
a
second
level
are
the
policies
and
practices
of
individual
eresearch
projects
whether
the
materials
relating
to
projects
|||
ongoing
research
are
deposited
in
a
common
or
openly
shared
|||
repository
how
software
tools
are
licensed
various
options
of
|||
open
source
licensing
and
whether
data
or
publications
resulting
|||
from
the
project
are
made
available
on
project
webpages
or
other
|||
shared
repositories
|||
a
major
push
especially
from
research
|||
funding
bodies
has
been
to
encourage
open
practices
|||
for
|||
example
an
increasing
number
of
funding
bodies
stipulate
that
|||
funded
projects
must
make
their
results
freely
available
online
|||
perhaps
after
an
embargo
period
with
exclusive
rights
to
publish
|||
reserved
for
the
contributing
researcher
|||
what
we
found
in
|||
practice
however
according
to
indepth
interviews
with
|||
researchers
on
uk
escience
projects
is
that
practices
vary
|||
considerably
across
projects
|||
many
projects
are
uncertain
|||
about
what
the
policies
about
copyright
and
licensing
are
they
|||
often
adopt
ad
hoc
policies
with
regard
to
which
project
members
|||
have
access
to
ongoing
materials
created
by
the
project
and
|||
finally
they
are
in
the
early
stages
of
and
still
unsure
about
|||
depositing
outputs
such
as
data
to
a
common
repository
or
|||
publishing
results
online
as
opposed
to
via
the
traditional
|||
mechanism
of
journals
|||
a
third
example
are
the
shared
middleware
software
tools
tools
|||
which
mediate
between
the
shared
computing
infrastructure
and
|||
the
individual
projects
or
enduser
researchers
|||
on
this
mesolevel
we
can
take
case
of
the
open
middleware
infrastructure
|||
institute
omii
in
the
uk
as
an
example
|||
omii
aims
to
create
a
|||
suite
of
widely
adopted
standard
tools
which
are
held
and
|||
maintained
in
a
repository
and
made
accessible
to
all
researchers
|||
omii
has
been
promoted
by
the
uk
escience
programme
and
|||
has
also
involved
the
collaboration
of
commercial
software
|||
vendors
such
as
microsoft
and
ibm
|||
however
despite
a
push
|||
towards
open
source
licensing
and
standards
the
practice
has
|||
been
more
complex
|||
it
has
proved
difficult
for
example
to
|||
achieve
standardization
and
the
efforts
to
transform
the
software
|||
from
the
bespoke
form
that
it
has
within
a
project
into
a
product
|||
that
can
be
shared
by
many
researchers
has
often
proved
to
be
|||
greater
than
creating
the
software
in
the
first
place
|||
in
short
there
have
been
major
efforts
to
promote
the
openness
of
|||
eresearch
and
policy
debates
and
debates
among
researchers
|||
continue
about
the
issues
that
have
been
described
here
|||
it
is
|||
too
early
to
predict
the
outcome
of
a
process
that
is
still
under
|||
way
but
by
disaggregating
openness
into
a
number
of
levels
and
|||
component
parts
gathering
materials
on
the
various
levels
and
|||
identifying
the
tensions
and
forces
at
work
oess
will
able
to
|||
analyze
this
issue
locate
it
among
the
other
key
themes
of
the
|||
projects
there
are
clearly
connections
between
openness
and
for
|||
example
data
sharing
and
assess
the
implications
for
scientific
|||
practices
|||
open
science
also
has
the
potential
to
transform
research
practices
|||
on
multiple
levels
|||
at
one
level
having
research
data
openly
|||
available
enables
secondary
use
which
potentially
allows
less
|||
advantaged
researchers
to
participate
in
scientific
discovery
even
|||
if
they
dont
have
access
to
the
resources
necessary
to
gather
|||
highquality
datasets
|||
of
course
there
are
other
limitations
|||
beyond
simply
access
to
data
when
trying
to
understand
why
|||
certain
scholars
have
greater
scholarly
output
but
lowering
|||
the
barrier
will
potentially
increase
participation
|||
at
another
|||
level
open
data
also
exposes
research
data
to
the
same
sort
of
|||
peer
review
that
scholarly
publications
now
undergo
|||
currently
|||
there
is
little
provision
in
the
practice
of
science
for
datasets
to
|||
undergo
peer
review
beyond
a
short
methodological
description
in
|||
a
publication
|||
if
data
becomes
more
open
and
subject
to
peer
|||
review
the
quality
of
the
data
being
used
to
create
scientific
|||
knowledge
will
potentially
be
transformed
for
the
better
|||
constraints
on
eresearch
|||
a
number
of
the
themes
and
issues
identified
by
the
oess
project
|||
pertain
to
constraints
limiting
the
uptake
of
eresearch
among
|||
scholars
|||
privacy
for
instance
is
a
serious
concern
to
all
|||
researchers
collecting
data
on
human
subjects
|||
while
quantitative
|||
research
data
is
often
relatively
easy
to
anonymize
and
many
|||
quantitative
researchers
routinely
create
deidentified
or
limited
|||
data
sets
qualitative
researchers
have
not
generally
had
to
deal
|||
with
this
issue
in
the
past
|||
since
few
qualitative
data
sets
were
|||
shared
outside
the
original
research
team
there
was
little
reason
|||
to
deidentify
the
data
|||
the
challenge
in
deidentifying
qualitative
|||
data
is
nontrivial
compared
to
the
relative
ease
of
simply
|||
excluding
several
columns
of
quantitative
data
|||
video
recordings
|||
include
images
of
participants
audio
recordings
can
be
identified
|||
by
the
sound
of
a
persons
voice
and
transcribed
interview
data
|||
often
includes
references
to
other
people
by
name
and
other
|||
identifying
information
|||
it
has
been
suggested
that
improving
the
|||
quality
of
qualitative
data
is
an
important
goal
for
social
|||
researchers
and
that
transparency
about
the
data
and
the
research
|||
process
are
key
elements
to
doing
so
|||
the
question
of
how
to
|||
share
such
rich
data
while
continuing
to
protect
the
identity
of
|||
research
subjects
however
is
a
major
barrier
to
collaboratively
|||
sharing
qualitative
research
data
|||
whether
the
promise
of
gains
|||
offered
by
collaboratively
sharing
qualitative
research
data
is
|||
great
enough
to
overcome
these
constraints
remains
to
be
seen
if
|||
it
is
it
would
potentially
mark
a
major
transformation
in
the
|||
generally
solitary
and
opaque
manner
in
which
much
qualitative
|||
data
is
collected
|||
this
also
relates
to
another
key
theme
being
developed
by
oess
|||
researchers
carusi
and
jirotka
trust
|||
trust
can
take
many
forms
|||
and
includes
different
sorts
of
trust
such
as
the
trust
people
place
|||
in
artefacts
and
the
trust
people
have
for
those
who
make
use
of
|||
artefacts
|||
trust
is
central
to
human
relationships
in
general
|||
and
to
scientific
collaboration
in
particular
without
trust
people
|||
are
unlikely
to
share
and
collaborate
|||
this
is
an
issue
for
|||
individual
researchers
and
research
participants
on
a
wider
level
|||
it
is
also
a
question
about
peoples
trust
in
government
and
|||
researchers
generally
|||
even
in
sweden
for
example
which
is
|||
generally
a
high
trust
country
in
this
respect
to
continue
to
|||
maintain
this
trust
and
extend
it
in
the
face
of
new
eresearch
|||
possibilities
that
are
being
developed
takes
much
effort
|||
while
it
is
therefore
possible
to
build
information
systems
that
|||
inspire
trust
because
of
high
levels
of
perceived
security
that
trust
|||
can
be
easily
destroyed
by
the
most
minor
of
breaches
|||
trust
|||
between
individual
scientists
is
equally
hard
to
maintain
since
it
|||
relies
mainly
on
interpersonal
characteristics
|||
the
challenge
for
|||
eresearch
then
is
to
understand
which
elements
of
the
research
|||
process
are
most
reliant
on
trust
and
to
ensure
that
trust
is
not
|||
undermined
by
the
technologies
and
processes
expected
of
|||
contributors
|||
another
concern
that
has
been
expressed
by
eresearch
projects
|||
pertains
to
the
economic
constraints
academic
researchers
face
|||
when
compared
to
industry
players
|||
ncess
nodes
are
generally
|||
small
demonstrator
projects
with
little
or
no
support
for
the
|||
eventual
development
of
mature
research
tools
with
the
extensive
|||
user
support
that
would
be
required
if
usage
were
to
become
|||
widespread
|||
there
is
a
feeling
among
some
in
the
eresearch
|||
community
that
the
most
likely
outcome
of
many
of
these
|||
academic
demonstrators
will
be
that
industry
players
will
see
that
|||
some
of
them
are
viable
approaches
to
a
problem
and
the
industry
|||
developers
will
then
create
a
package
which
will
trickle
back
|||
down
to
the
research
community
in
several
years
time
|||
there
is
already
some
evidence
for
this
recent
speculation
in
|||
wired
magazines
blog
reports
rumours
that
google
is
developing
|||
a
project
code
named
palimpset
to
host
opensource
science
data
|||
in
a
tool
that
will
include
commenting
and
annotating
features
|||
googles
resources
are
far
more
extensive
than
those
of
|||
academic
projects
whether
this
project
develops
into
something
|||
more
substantial
remains
to
be
seen
but
it
could
become
a
major
|||
player
in
academic
research
if
the
success
of
google
scholar
is
|||
any
indication
|||
should
wellfunded
industry
players
decide
to
|||
move
into
the
eresearch
arena
in
a
serious
way
the
entire
|||
landscape
of
eresearch
may
be
transformed
|||
while
many
other
constraints
have
limited
the
early
uptake
of
eresearch
these
few
examples
should
give
an
idea
of
the
types
of
|||
issues
we
have
identified
and
the
potential
for
transformation
in
|||
science
if
these
constraints
can
be
overcome
|||
we
next
turn
to
|||
several
enablers
for
eresearch
|||
enablers
for
eresearch
|||
funding
shifts
|||
as
indicated
in
the
introduction
to
this
paper
shifts
in
funding
in
|||
the
u
|||
k
|||
the
u
|||
s
|||
and
elsewhere
are
major
drivers
behind
the
|||
push
to
eresearch
|||
the
shifts
at
nsf
towards
transformative
|||
research
and
the
growth
in
the
cyberinfrastructure
funding
|||
program
attract
new
proposals
|||
likewise
programs
in
the
u
|||
k
|||
such
as
ncess
encourage
researchers
to
focus
their
attention
on
|||
developing
tools
and
methods
that
enable
eresearch
|||
if
these
|||
and
other
programs
in
the
u
|||
s
|||
the
u
|||
k
|||
and
elsewhere
continue
|||
to
push
new
funds
to
eresearch
development
the
predictions
of
|||
the
funders
that
eresearch
will
become
a
central
focus
of
science
|||
becomes
a
selffulfilling
prophecy
and
the
likelihood
of
|||
transformations
in
the
practice
of
science
become
much
more
|||
likely
|||
new
scientific
questions
|||
the
ability
to
potentially
answer
previously
unanswerable
|||
scientific
questions
may
be
the
most
important
driver
behind
the
|||
push
to
eresearch
|||
this
is
particularly
true
in
certain
scientific
|||
fields
where
access
to
massive
datasets
may
be
the
only
way
to
|||
answer
particular
scientific
questions
|||
in
biomedical
genetics
|||
research
for
instance
very
few
of
the
disorders
for
which
|||
scientists
are
trying
to
identify
a
genetic
basis
are
triggered
by
a
|||
single
gene
waiting
to
be
discovered
|||
instead
many
disorders
are
|||
suspected
to
be
triggered
by
complex
multiple
gene
interactions
|||
and
may
also
be
influenced
by
interactions
between
genes
and
an
|||
individuals
environment
|||
as
such
many
genetic
studies
discuss
|||
measuring
genetic
risk
for
developing
a
particular
disorder
rather
|||
than
discovering
a
gene
responsible
for
the
disorder
|||
because
this
|||
is
much
more
complex
than
identifying
a
gene
in
the
population
|||
genetics
researchers
are
finding
that
they
must
rely
on
everlarger
|||
datasets
if
they
are
to
have
any
hope
of
discovering
the
genetic
|||
alleles
that
place
subjects
at
risk
for
disease
|||
one
way
the
|||
scientists
are
doing
this
by
contributing
their
collections
of
subject
|||
data
and
dna
to
larger
collections
such
as
the
gain
example
|||
described
above
|||
by
increasing
the
number
of
dna
samples
|||
available
at
the
same
time
as
increasing
the
amount
of
data
|||
available
from
each
sample
genetics
researchers
hope
to
find
|||
better
indicators
of
genetic
risk
in
the
populations
they
study
|||
another
type
of
research
that
can
only
really
be
done
|||
collaboratively
is
astronomy
|||
astronomers
have
long
shared
|||
resources
such
as
telescopes
and
sky
data
|||
there
are
currently
|||
several
international
projects
designed
to
create
virtual
|||
observatories
in
the
u
|||
k
|||
astrogrid
the
u
|||
s
|||
nasas
national
|||
vo
europe
eurovo
and
elsewhere
|||
these
projects
have
|||
been
built
to
enable
astronomers
to
work
with
data
that
is
stored
|||
distributed
across
the
grid
and
analysed
using
parallel
processing
|||
techniques
|||
the
astrogrid
project
for
instance
can
find
process
|||
and
analyse
data
from
a
given
patch
of
sky
that
has
been
collected
|||
from
any
instrument
to
which
the
project
has
access
to
the
data
on
|||
the
grid
|||
only
the
small
portions
of
the
data
that
are
the
result
of
|||
calculations
need
to
be
transferred
back
the
astronomer
rather
|||
than
requiring
him
or
her
to
download
a
large
dataset
and
work
|||
with
the
data
natively
|||
as
these
tools
become
more
widely
used
|||
astronomers
are
able
to
spend
less
time
working
with
data
and
|||
more
time
doing
analytic
science
|||
a
final
example
of
how
these
collaborative
resources
can
|||
transform
practice
in
a
scientific
field
comes
from
the
field
of
|||
oceanography
|||
lamb
has
described
how
oceanographers
are
|||
now
able
to
use
remote
sensing
to
transform
the
practice
of
eventdriven
science
|||
the
traditional
means
of
collecting
oceanographic
|||
data
was
to
send
ships
out
to
sea
and
wait
for
the
types
of
events
|||
the
scientists
needed
data
on
to
occur
|||
in
recent
years
however
|||
oceanographers
have
been
building
extensive
networks
of
remote
|||
sensing
devices
located
throughout
the
oceans
|||
now
the
|||
scientists
can
monitor
the
readings
from
their
offices
|||
also
if
an
|||
interesting
event
begins
about
which
they
would
like
to
collect
|||
additional
information
onsite
they
can
be
notified
of
this
by
the
|||
remote
sensors
and
then
dispatch
a
ship
to
sail
to
the
location
of
|||
interest
|||
this
represents
an
enormous
savings
in
time
and
money
|||
for
the
oceanographers
and
also
allows
them
to
collect
much
|||
more
data
than
before
|||
if
the
necessity
of
harnessing
massive
resources
is
a
major
enabler
|||
for
eresearch
this
may
offer
a
clue
to
the
relatively
slow
uptake
|||
of
the
collaborative
and
gridbased
elements
of
eresearch
|||
among
social
scientists
|||
social
scientists
have
traditionally
been
|||
trained
as
primarily
autonomous
researchers
working
|||
individually
or
on
small
teams
|||
the
datasets
generated
are
often
|||
small
and
easily
managed
and
analyzed
using
desktop
computing
|||
applications
|||
unlike
running
complex
astronomical
calculations
|||
even
the
largest
social
surveys
rarely
tax
the
processing
|||
capabilities
of
spss
or
sas
on
the
desktop
|||
for
many
social
|||
scientists
the
grid
doesnt
appear
to
offer
compellingly
attractive
|||
applications
at
this
time
|||
even
for
social
scientists
using
|||
quantitative
statistics
or
largescale
social
network
analysis
|||
sna
their
computational
requirements
do
not
generally
|||
approach
those
of
scientists
modelling
complex
biological
|||
physical
or
astronomical
systems
|||
that
may
change
if
some
sort
|||
of
killer
app
is
developed
but
even
so
there
will
be
disciplinary
|||
resistance
to
a
change
in
the
normal
practices
of
science
|||
future
work
|||
future
work
on
the
oess
project
will
move
beyond
monitoring
|||
how
various
eresearch
projects
negotiate
the
constraints
with
|||
which
they
are
faced
to
include
identifying
more
of
the
ways
in
|||
which
eresearch
realizes
the
promise
of
transformation
for
|||
research
and
with
what
consequences
|||
this
will
be
done
through
|||
additional
case
studies
and
through
additional
expansion
to
a
|||
consideration
of
more
international
cases
including
examination
|||
of
how
national
research
policies
influence
the
uptake
of
eresearch
techniques
|||
discussion
|||
while
many
transformations
have
taken
place
in
early
eresearch
|||
projects
a
more
widespread
transformation
of
research
practice
|||
has
remained
elusive
|||
the
projects
have
undergone
|||
transformation
some
notions
about
the
possibility
of
eresearch
|||
have
been
transformed
and
certain
scientific
fields
have
seen
|||
significant
transformations
in
the
way
that
they
work
and
the
|||
types
of
scientific
questions
they
are
able
to
ask
|||
for
many
|||
scientists
social
scientists
and
other
academic
researchers
eresearch
is
still
not
central
to
their
work
|||
one
of
the
challenges
in
understanding
the
nature
of
how
eresearch
is
developing
is
that
many
of
the
projects
developing
eresearch
tools
have
until
fairly
recently
been
primarily
|||
developing
tools
that
had
not
yet
been
released
or
tested
widely
in
|||
realworld
settings
|||
as
the
efforts
have
matured
however
it
has
|||
become
feasible
to
study
these
projects
and
to
begin
developing
|||
an
understanding
of
the
social
shaping
that
has
occurred
and
the
|||
social
organizational
ethical
and
legal
issues
that
are
associated
|||
with
the
projects
|||
for
each
of
the
topics
discussed
in
this
paper
|||
the
examples
are
often
of
projects
that
have
advanced
far
enough
|||
beyond
their
early
stages
to
have
created
tools
that
are
being
used
|||
by
scientists
|||
in
this
way
we
are
able
to
examine
transformations
|||
in
tools
projects
scientific
practice
and
the
formulation
of
|||
scientific
questions
|||
in
some
areas
early
results
indicate
that
|||
many
transformations
have
taken
place
|||
for
instance
at
the
|||
microlevel
many
of
the
projects
have
experienced
significant
|||
transformation
from
their
earliest
roots
as
the
initial
ideas
were
|||
shaped
by
experience
|||
as
schroeder
fry
have
observed
the
|||
obstacles
to
the
effectiveness
of
escience
are
not
so
much
|||
technical
as
social
|||
these
social
barriers
are
part
of
the
|||
feedback
loops
that
operate
as
the
projects
transform
over
time
|||
at
other
levels
however
there
is
currently
less
evidence
that
eresearch
tools
and
einfrastructures
have
yet
transformed
either
|||
mesolevel
practices
of
ordinary
science
or
macrolevel
questions
|||
that
science
is
able
to
imagine
and
study
|||
one
question
that
|||
remains
is
whether
this
lack
of
fundamental
transformation
is
a
|||
temporary
problem
which
will
disappear
as
tools
become
better
|||
developed
and
more
widely
used
or
whether
there
are
larger
|||
issues
that
make
it
unlikely
that
science
will
be
transformed
so
|||
much
as
reinforced
by
eresearch
tools
|||
if
the
former
is
true
then
|||
it
becomes
just
a
matter
of
time
and
effort
to
reach
the
critical
|||
mass
required
for
transformation
|||
and
if
mass
adoption
of
these
|||
tools
seems
an
ambitious
target
it
can
be
noted
that
research
|||
technologies
have
in
the
past
been
drivers
for
scientific
changes
|||
because
the
tools
have
migrated
across
different
applications
and
|||
disciplinary
domains
|||
if
the
latter
is
true
however
then
one
|||
needs
to
examine
the
underlying
forces
that
operate
to
resist
|||
changes
in
scientific
practice
and
instead
coopt
new
tools
to
the
|||
service
of
existing
patterns
|||
indeed
it
is
very
difficult
to
predict
|||
in
advance
whether
new
scientific
tools
are
likelier
to
support
|||
normal
science
or
to
enable
paradigm
shifts
to
use
the
language
|||
of
kuhn
|||
we
are
very
early
in
the
story
of
eresearch
|||
some
elements
such
|||
as
electronically
accessible
journals
are
well
developed
while
|||
others
such
as
gridenabled
applications
for
social
scientists
are
|||
in
their
infancy
|||
the
extent
to
which
any
of
these
will
prove
to
be
|||
transformative
remains
to
be
seen
but
we
would
predict
that
most
|||
will
instead
tend
to
reinforce
existing
patterns
of
scholarship
|||
particularly
in
the
short
term
|||
we
will
continue
to
research
these
|||
issues
however
and
eagerly
await
new
developments
in
eresearch
