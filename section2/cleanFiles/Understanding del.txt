we
developed

a
popular
social

that
allowed

to
simulate

choosing

using
one
of
four
possible
strategies
for

choice
found
in
the

we
then
compared
the

resulting
tag
choices
with
empirical
data
retrieved
from

to
determine
which
tag

strategies
would

result
in
choices
most
similar
to
those
seen
in

|||
we
were
able
to
rule
out
three
of

critically
on

argue

are
not
random
instead
consensus
seems
to
emerge
for

which

represent
a

they
show

that
web

bookmarked

demonstrate
a

stable

distribution
following
a
powerlaw
pattern
in
which
the

few

are
chosen
by
many

users
while
most
other

are
selected
by
only
a
few

the
long

of
the

includes
hundreds
more

used
by
only
one

golder
and

speculate
that
this

might

be
due
to

imitating

henceforth
called
the

empirical

in
this
way
we

similar

in

producing

that

the
research
literature
contains
multiple
competing
explanations
for
the
patterns
of

that
appear
on

del

us
|||
all
of
these
explanations
initially
seem
like

reasonable
explanations
of
the
way
that
del

icio

us
users
|||
choose
tags

but
they
cannot
all
be
right
simultaneously
|||
it
would
be
nice
to
actually
have
collections
of
real
people
|||
specifically
use
one
or
more
of
the
strategies
suggested
by
|||
the
literature
on
delicious
|||
we
could
then
see
if
those

tag
choices
resulted
in
patterns
of
tags
similar
to
those
|||
found
on
del

icio

us
|||
unfortunately
this
technique
would
|||
be
prohibitively
costly
|||
instead
we
developed
a
computational
simulation
of
users
doing
this
|||
this
simulation
|||
allows
us
to
control
exactly
what
strategy
the
simulated
|||
users
used
to
choose
tags
|||
such
a
simulation
cannot
tell

us
which
strategy
the
real
users
of
del

icio

us
used
it
can
|||
only
tell
us
which
strategies
are
likely
to
result
in
patterns
|||
of
tags
that
are
similar
to
those
observed
on
del
|||
icio
|||
us
|||
in
other
words
the
simulation
cannot
confidently
identify
how
users
chose
tags
but
it
can
be
used
to
rule
out
|||
explanations
that
are
unlikely
to
generate
the
observed
|||
patterns
of
tags
|||
we
began
by
downloading
and
parsing
the
entire
bookmark
and
tag
histories
for
approximately
different
|||
websites
in
del
|||
icio
|||
us
|||
we
generated
the
tag
frequency
|||
distribution
for
a
randomly
selected
subset
of
those
websites
and
compared
it
against
seven
known
distribution
|||
types
powerlaw
lognormal
geometric
etc
|||
to
determine
the
best
fit
|||
knowing
the
family
of
distributions
to
|||
which
the
del

icio
|||
us
tag
frequency
distribution
belongs
|||
allowed
us
to
statistically
determine
whether
the
distributions
produced
by
our
simulation
were
of
the
same
type
|||
next
we
developed
a
simulation
of
users
tag
choices
|||
details
of
which
will
be
provided
later
in
the

|||
the

simulation
was
instructed
to
follow
each
one
of
the
four
|||
strategies
listed
above
in
turn
|||
for
each
strategy
|||
different
websites
were
simulated
for
each
website
users

simulated
tag
selections
were
recorded
and
statistically

compared
with
the
empirical
distribution
|||
we
ran
the
simulation
for
four
different
tag
selection
|||
strategies
and
compared
the
results
with
the
tag
frequency
distribution
observed
on
del

icio

|||
we
then
used
|||
statistical
techniques
to
determine
whether
the
simulated

tag
selection
strategies
were
consistent
with
the
empirically
observed
data
|||
we
tested
the
following
strategies

we
were
primarily
interested
in
looking
at
two
specific

patterns
of

as

pointed
out

the

to
follow

used

estimate
two
distributions
the

distribution
of

frequency
for
a
given
website
bookmarked
how
frequently
was
each

applied
to

and

the
number
of

chosen
by

when

is

how

apply

it
has
long
been
accepted
that

people
use

imprecisely
and

is
negotiated
on
the

during

|||
this
imprecision

is
evident
not
only
in

but
also
when
people
are
asked
to
create

when

the
probability
that

will
generate
the

the

problem
is
widely
held
to
be
less
than

when

wants
to
take
advantage
of
the

collective
properties
of
social
bookmarking
by
browsing

or
searching
on

the
vocabulary
problem
becomes

apparent
|||
if
users
are
unlikely
to
choose
the
same
tags
to

represent
the
same
topics
such
diversity
would
decrease

search
precision
|||
when
a
given
tag
is
applied
to

in
an
inconsistent
manner
by
many
users
more

variability
exists
in
the
content
returned
when
a

searches
with
that

the

may
be

returned

there
would
be

in

we

exponent

explains
that
