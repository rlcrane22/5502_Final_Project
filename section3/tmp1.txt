abstract

introduction
|||
integrity
of
content
is
a
generic
issue
in
curation
and
preservation
|||
but
has
not
been
extensively
studied
in
relation
to
scientific
data
|||
data
are
now
being
seen
as
an
important
end
product
of
|||
scholarship
in
themselves
|||
in
this
paper
we
will
discuss
data
|||
integrity
issues
in
relation
to
environmental
and
ecological
data
|||
and
the
implications
of
these
issues
on
the
development
of
data
|||
digital
libraries
|||
for
users
to
trust
and
interpret
the
data
in
|||
scientific
digital
libraries
they
must
be
able
to
assess
the
integrity
|||
of
those
data
|||
criteria
for
data
integrity
vary
by
context
by
|||
scientific
problem
by
individual
and
a
variety
of
other
factors
|||
the
goal
of
this
research
is
to
identify
functional
requirements
for
|||
digital
libraries
of
scientific
data
encompassing
both
technical
|||
and
social
factors
that
can
affect
data
integrity
|||
mechanisms
to
|||
ensure
data
integrity
have
to
be
present
at
each
stage
in
the
data
|||
life
cycle
from
data
collection
to
data
preservation
and
curation
|||
the
implications
of
our
research
on
data
integrity
are
multifold
|||
for
the
ischool
research
community
and
we
hope
to
promote
|||
discussion
of
these
issues
|||
preserving
digital
information
is
a
central
concern
to
the
design
of
|||
information
infrastructure
|||
digital
information
takes
many
forms
|||
and
one
of
increasing
importance
is
scientific
data
|||
data
are
much
|||
less
selfarchiving
than
are
publications
however
and
often
|||
require
more
human
effort
to
describe
and
to
provide
context
for
|||
interpretation
|||
when
engaged
in
their
own
research
|||
scientific
researchers
take
steps
to
ensure
the
quality
and
integrity
|||
of
the
data
they
capture
|||
however
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
|||
researchers
to
evaluate
data
that
are
collected
by
others
because
of
|||
the
lack
of
standardization
in
the
ways
that
data
are
documented
|||
and
annotated
|||
these
standards
are
necessary
to
provide
enough

information
to
enable
reuse

researchers
want

in

that
assures
its

similarly
librarians

future
users
of

want
to
be
assured
of
the

of
the

over

but
what
does
integrity
mean
in
this

environment
and
to
whom
we
draw
upon
our
research
on
data

practices
conducted
at
a
large
collaborative
multidisciplinary

to
compare

equally
important
in

is
the

such

those
in

the

has
contributed
to
an
increase
in
the

however
because

the

challenges

environmental

face
the
questions
of

they

this

able
to
integrate

complicates
the

who
wish

rely
on
a

of
indicators

indicators
include
the

the

|||
assessing

integrity
is
especially
difficult
in
the

environmental
sciences
where

vary
widely
from

|||
ecological
research
questions
are
typically

focused
on
specific
locales
or
on
particular

because
of
this
research

widely
between

even
multisite
comparatives
such
as

the

lters
are
not

immune
from
this
diversity
as
the
highly
unpredictable
and
|||
variable
nature
of
infield
ecological
research
demands
flexibility
|||
researchers
in
the
ecological
and
environmental
sciences
must
be
|||
able
to
design
customized
solutions
to
local
and
unforeseen

challenges

because
of
this
assessing
the
integrity
of

is
a

complex
and
difficult
task

research
context

to
examine
these
issues
we
are
studying

data
integrity
issues
are
becoming
more
salient
within
cens
as

the
new
wireless
sensing
technologies
and
the
scientific

applications
using
those
technologies
have
each
matured
|||
in
the
|||
initial
stages
of
cens
research
the
primary
focus
was
developing
|||
new
wireless
sensing
system
technology
|||
as
is
typically
the
case
|||
with
new
technology
development
the
first
few
generations
of
|||
systems
were
often
unreliable
sometimes
producing
data
with
|||
scientific
value
and
other
times
not
|||
cens
has
now
reached
the
|||
point
where
the
nascent
technology
is
consistently
producing
data
|||
of
real
scientific
value
and
as
such
must
now
take
means
to
|||
address
longterm
data
preservation
and
access
issues
|||
additionally
questions
about
the
integrity
of
data
are
coming
to
|||
the
fore
as
more
useful
data
are
being
produced
|||
until
recently
cens
relied
on
a
largely
oral
culture
for
the
|||
exchange
of
data
and
for
the
exchange
of
information
about
how
|||
data
are
collected
such
as
the
equipment
used
and
the
state
of
the
|||
equipment
|||
as
the
center
has
grown
an
oral
culture
is
no
longer
|||
sufficient
to
capture
and
retain
institutional
memory
|||
the
student
|||
research
population
turns
over
rapidly
and
tacit
knowledge
needs
|||
to
be
exchanged
within
and
between
many
more
research
teams
|||
future
uses
of
cens
data
depend
on
identifying
and
|||
implementing
solutions
for
data
preservation
and
access

challenges

background
on

cens

result
from
sensor
deployments
where
researchers
|||
deploy

and
wireless
communication
equipment
in
realworld
field
locations
|||
assessing
the
integrity
of
data
captured

during

is

the

following
sections
illustrate
how
the
task
of
ensuring
data

integrity
is
both
a
technical
and
a
social
process
|||
technical
data
integrity
issues
|||
within
cens
a
group
of
computer
scientists
statisticians
and
|||
electrical
engineering
researchers
have
formed
the
cens
|||
integrity
group
devoted
to
looking
at
the
technical
aspects
of
|||
wireless
sensing
system
data
integrity
|||
the
cens
integrity
group
|||
focuses
on
sensor
fault
detection
that
is
detecting
when
sensor
|||
output
does
not
accurately
represent
the
phenomena
being
|||
measured
|||
fault
detection
is
often
viewed
as
a
step
in
postdeployment
data
analysis
where
data
is
rejected
during
analysis
if
|||
it
is
deemed
to
be
faulty
|||
however
this
approach
is
flawed
for
a
|||
couple
of
reasons
|||
first
it
may
not
be
possible
to
tell
what
data
|||
are
faulty
after
the
fact
and
second
the
amount
of
data
available
|||
after
a
challenging
deployment
may
be
so
small
that
none
can
be
|||
spared
|||
this
is
particularly
the
case
on
experiments
where
sensors
|||
are
shortlived
and
require
frequent
calibration
|||
cens
researchers
|||
have
had
to
discard
as
much
as
of
the
data
collected
on
a
|||
particular
deployment
limiting
the
amount
of
scientific
analysis
|||
possible
|||
for
these
reasons
the
cens
integrity
group
is
researching
fault
|||
detection
methods
that
would
identify
sensor
faults
as
data
is
|||
being
captured
in
the
field
|||
there
are
many
challenges
in
this
task
|||
as
sensor
faults
can
take
many
forms
such
as
out
of
range
values
|||
and
have
a
number
of
possible
causes
each
requiring
a
different
|||
detection
method
|||
often
faults
compound
each
other
such
as
|||
when
a
failing
battery
causes
a
sensor
to
give
faulty
readings
|||
this
|||
technical
data
integrity
work
is
important
because
it
indicates
that
|||
the
embedded
networked
sensing
community
is
becoming
aware
|||
of
the
complexity
of
data
integrity
issues
even
if
the
mechanisms
|||
and
techniques
they
are
developing
for
automated
and
humanmediated
data
integrity
checks
in
sensor
systems
are
in
the
very
|||
beginning
stages
|||
once
these
mechanisms
mature
they
will
be
an
|||
integral
component
of
scientific
research
that
uses
sensor
|||
networks
|||
social
data
integrity
issues
|||
sensor
faults
represent
a
technical
impediment
to
ensuring
data
|||
integrity
|||
equally
|||
important
|||
social
|||
cultural
|||
and
|||
economic

|||
birnholtz
and
|||
bietz
point
out
that
many
factors
play
into
data
sharing
|||
practices
|||
understanding
a
data
set
requires
knowledge
of
the
|||
context
in
which
it
was
collected
|||
documenting
the
data
collection
|||
process
is
challenging
however
because
much
of
the
knowledge
|||
that
goes
into
collecting
and
interpreting
a
data
set
is
tacit
|||
knowledge
transfer
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
sharing
a
set
of
|||
instructions
but
is
a
highly
social
process
of
learning
practices
|||
that
are
not
easily
documented
pg
|||
they
identify
three
|||
recommendations
for
the
design
of
systems
to
share
scientific
|||
data
support
social
interaction
around
data
abstractions
and
|||
the
data
themselves
do
not
rely
on
metadata
alone
it
is
also
|||
necessary
to
support
the
sharing
of
supplementary
materials
that
|||
enhance
the
value
of
the
data
and
support
social
and
scientific
|||
roles
of
data
|||
because
tacit
knowledge
is
such
an
integral
part
of
|||
ecological
research
producing
data
set
documentation
is
timeconsuming
and
laborintensive
process
|||
cultural
data
integrity
issues
|||
data
collections
in
the
environmental
and
ecological
sciences
are
|||
primarily
research
data
collections
that
were
collected
for
a
|||
specific
purpose
and
are
typically
held
by
the
researchers
who
|||
created
them
|||
it
is
therefore
often
difficult
for
researchers
to
|||
discover
and
access
research
data
that
was
collected
by
someone
|||
else
|||
as
zimmerman
notes
ecologists
face
a
litany
of
|||
challenges
in
finding
data
|||
because
few
ecological
databases
|||
exist
the
ecologists
zimmerman
studied
looked
to
many
other
|||
sources
for
data
including
peerreviewed
publications
museums
|||
and
personal
contacts
|||
once
relevant
data
was
found
they
went
|||
to
great
lengths
to
ensure
that
they
understand
data
collected
by
|||
others
pg
|||
relying
on
their
own
field
expertise
to
evaluate
|||
the
potential
problems
with
given
data
|||
additionally
when
combining
disparate
data
sets
researchers
|||
often
ignored
small
differences
between
data
sets
with
the
hope
|||
that
small
amounts
of
bad
data
or
incompatibilities
between
data
|||
sets
will
not
affect
how
they
can
be
analyzed
|||
peerreviewed
|||
literature
are
generally
a
good
source
of
information
about
data
|||
but
peerreview
typically
does
not
certify
data
quality
per
se
as
|||
publications
rarely
report
the
actual
raw
data
on
which
they
are
|||
based
|||
similarly
databases
are
challenging
to
use
because
they
|||
often
do
not
provide
enough
information
to
determine
the
|||
purposes
for
which
data
was
collected
|||
despite
the
challenges
scientists
find
ways
to
get
access
to
the
|||
data
they
need
|||
however
tremendous
amounts
of
time
and
|||
energy
are
spent
in
the
process
of
finding
evaluating
and
|||
integrating
data
|||
better
methods
for
data
documentation
and
|||
access
would
make
it
much
easier
for
scientists
to
discover
and
|||
share
data
and
just
as
importantly
evaluate
the
integrity
of
data
|||
collected
by
others
|||
understanding
the
requirements
for
such
|||
methods
is
the
focus
of
our
research
|||
research
methodology
|||
we
have
identified
a
number
of
critical
research
areas
regarding
|||
cens
data
practices
and
are
pursuing
a
multipronged
research
|||
approach
|||
we
recently
completed
a
series
of
interviews
with
|||
scientists
from
five
environmental
science
projects
within
cens
|||
for
each
project
we
interviewed
a
complementary
set
of
science
|||
and
technology
participants
including
faculty
postdoctoral
|||
fellows
graduate
students
and
research
staff
|||
we
interviewed
|||
participants
each
for
minutes
to
two
hours
interviews
|||
averaged
minutes
|||
interview
questions
were
grouped
into
these
|||
four
categories
data
characteristics
data
sharing
data
policy
and
|||
data
architecture
|||
the
interviews
were
audiotaped
transcribed
|||
and
complemented
by
the
interviewers
memos
on
topics
and
|||
themes
|||
analysis
proceeded
to
identify
emergent
themes
|||
this
study
used
the
methods
of
grounded
theory
to
identify
|||
themes
and
to
test
them
in
the
full
corpus
of
interview
transcripts
|||
and
notes
|||
the
next
planned
stages
of
our
research
are
based
on
findings
and
|||
gaps
identified
by
this
interview
study
and
encompass
|||
ethnographic
research
information
system
design
and
|||
quantitative
characterization
of
cens
collaborative
activities
|||
we
|||
are
developing
another
interview
study
that
will
focus
on
data
|||
versioning
and
provenance
within
cens
research
|||
this
study
is
in
|||
the
development
stages
but
will
seek
to
determine
in
what
states
|||
or
versions
data
sets
exist
and
how
these
states
are
documented
|||
additionally
we
are
examining
ways
that
wireless
sensing
|||
information
and
data
can
be
organized
through
the
development
|||
of
taxonomies
ontologies
or
metadata
models
|||
discussion
implications
for
|||
data
digital
library
design
|||
digital
libraries
can
facilitate
data
integrity
by
recognizing
and
|||
accounting
for
the
scientific
practices
and
requirements
|||
scientists
|||
have
established
methods
for
describing
their
communication
|||
networks
sensors
and
equipment
calibrations
but
often
this
|||
information
is
documented
separately
from
the
data
if
it
is
|||
documented
at
all
|||
among
the
many
research
questions
provoked
|||
by
our
research
are
how
digital
libraries
can
store
essential
|||
contextual
information
and
associate
it
with
relevant
data
points
|||
the
context
of
cens
data
collection
|||
within
cens
data
collection
largely
takes
place
on
realworld
|||
sensor
deployments
|||
we
have
designed
and
implemented
the
|||
cens
deployment
center
censdc
a
database
for
cens
|||
deployment
information
|||
the
censdc
provides
a
centralized
|||
webaccessible
location
for
researchers
to
articulate
and
document
|||
deployment
activities
through
the
creation
of
predeployment
|||
plans
and
postdeployment
feedbacknotes
|||
cens
researchers
|||
collaboratively
plan
sensor
deployments
prior
to
going
out
in
the
|||
field
|||
information
captured
in
deployment
plans
includes
|||
deployment
dates
locations
participants
technology
equipment
|||
tasks
and
other
notes
|||
the
system
also
facilitates
postdeployment
|||
information
capture
by
providing
a
series
of
fields
for
researchers
|||
to
outline
any
problems
they
encountered
while
in
the
field
as
|||
well
as
recommendations
and
suggestions
for
future
deployments
|||
the
development
of
the
censdc
has
followed
an
iterative
rapidprototyping
design
process
|||
requirements
for
the
system
were
|||
developed
through
ethnographic
study
of
cens
deployments
and
|||
discussions
with
cens
researchers
to
characterize
deployment
|||
practices
|||
much
of
the
infield
data
collection
process
during
|||
deployment
involves
tacit
knowledge
about
equipment
setups
|||
deployment
locations
and
field
preparations
from
past
|||
deployments
|||
as
cens
technologies
mature
and
current
|||
researchers
gain
deployment
experience
new
students
face
a
|||
steeper
learning
curve
when
joining
a
project
|||
the
censdc
was
|||
designed
to
capture
tacit
knowledge
and
contextual
information
|||
surrounding
infield
data
capture
and
to
serve
as
a
tool
for
|||
transfer
of
common
knowledge
knowledge
gained
through
field
|||
experiences
that
can
be
utilized
for
future
deployments
|||
the
|||
censdc
adds
value
to
cens
data
by
providing
a
source
of
|||
contextual
information
surrounding
the
data
collection
|||
this
|||
information
can
assist
researchers
in
writing
papers
proposals
|||
and
reviews
as
well
as
in
maintaining
their
data
and
leveraging
|||
them
for
reuse
by
others
|||
data
integrity
and
the
data
life
cycle
|||
we
have
proposed
that
digital
library
services
should
serve
|||
scientists
whose
data
exists
in
all
stages
of
the
data
life
cycle
|||
building
on
this
model
mechanisms
to
ensure
data
integrity
|||
will
also
have
to
be
present
at
each
stage
in
the
data
life
cycle
|||
prior
to
data
capture
equipment
are
tested
and
calibrated
|||
calibration
information
is
essential
to
postdeployment
data
|||
analysis
but
calibration
information
varies
for
each
type
of
|||
sensor
and
in
some
circumstances
even
between
sensors
of
the
|||
same
type
on
the
same
deployment
|||
issues
arise
such
as
the
level
|||
of
granularity
in
the
calibration
information
needs
to
be
associated
|||
with
each
data
set
|||
at
the
point
of
data
capture
it
will
be
essential
|||
that
data
digital
library
implementations
accommodate
and
|||
ideally
incorporate
automated
or
humanmediated
data
integrity
|||
checks
as
data
are
being
collected
|||
sensor
faults
have
a
huge
|||
impact
on
the
quality
and
quantity
of
data
generated
by
wireless
|||
sensing
system
deployments
and
researchers
must
be
able
to
|||
indicate
the
presence
of
these
faults
and
their
impact
on
the
|||
resulting
data
|||
similarly
contextual
information
around
the
data
capture
such
as
|||
the
equipment
and
software
used
is
critical
to
evaluate
data
|||
often
|||
this
information
is
not
documented
on
data
|||
contextual
|||
information
about
the
data
collection
process
is
particularly
|||
important
when
evaluating
data
collected
by
someone
else
|||
during
the
data
analysis
phase
data
sets
often
undergo
changes
as
|||
scientists
clean
integrate
and
analyze
data
|||
the
provenance
of
|||
these
changes
is
relevant
when
assessing
the
integrity
of
the
|||
resulting
data
as
it
may
be
necessary
to
backtrack
through
the
|||
data
analysis
steps
that
led
to
a
research
claim
|||
publications
are
currently
the
main
product
of
scientific
research
|||
but
as
data
and
other
scientific
information
is
increasingly
|||
available
online
it
would
be
very
valuable
to
be
able
to
identify
|||
relationships
between
resources
making
the
scholarly
value
chain
|||
explicit
|||
finally
curating
data
and
providing
effective
data
|||
stewardship
is
essential
if
data
are
to
be
used
and
reused
in
the
|||
future
|||
conclusion
implications
for
|||
ischool
research
|||
the
implications
of
our
research
on
data
integrity
are
multifold
|||
for
the
ischool
research
community
and
we
hope
to
promote
|||
discussion
of
these
issues
|||
data
are
a
growing
component
of
the
|||
scholarly
information
infrastructure
and
must
be
integrated
into
|||
larger
discussions
of
technology
institutions
practices
and
policy
|||
ischool
research
has
focused
much
more
on
documents
|||
than
on
data
|||
techniques
that
have
been
effective
in
promoting
|||
access
and
interoperability
of
documents
may
not
be
applicable
to
|||
data
and
other
digital
scientific
resources
|||
research
relating
to
|||
scientific
data
practices
and
data
preservation
and
curation
are
|||
small
but
growing
areas
of
ischool
expertise
|||
the
development
of
|||
a
larger
research
base
in
these
areas
is
critical
to
enhance
our
|||
understanding
of
the
cyberinfrastructure
blank
canvas
and
|||
to
facilitate
the
development
of
a
trained
workforce
of

scientists
|||
integrity
of
content
is
a
generic
issue
in
curation
and
preservation
|||
but
has
not
been
extensively
studied
in
relation
to
scientific
data
|||
as
data
are
increasingly
being
made
available
on
the
internet
|||
questions
about
ensuring
data
integrity
across
all
stages
of
the
data
|||
life
cycle
must
be
answered
|||
data
that
are
collected
on
by
|||
ecological
and
environmental
researchers
have
scientific
value
|||
both
to
immediate
research
questions
and
longterm
longitudinal
|||
studies
|||
distributed
longitudinal
studies
will
require
standards
that
|||
ensure
the
interoperability
of
the
sensor
the
network
and
the

|||
these
concerns
are
coming
to
