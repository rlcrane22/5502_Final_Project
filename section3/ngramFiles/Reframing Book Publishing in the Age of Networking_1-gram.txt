introduction
this
paper
presents
preliminary
results
of
an
ongoing
examination
of
book
publishing
practices
emerging
through
the
complex
interaction
of
technological
economic
and
sociocultural
factors
in
the
networking
environment
of
the
internet
the
theoretical
framework
guiding
the
study
is
a
diachronic
definition
of
book
publishing
proposed
by
thomas
r
adams
and
nicolas
barker
in
a
new
model
for
the
study
of
the
book
first
published
in
a
potency
of
life
books
in
society
by
the
british
library
in
and
reissued
in
in
paperback
by
the
british
library
and
oak
knoll
press
they
were
interested
in
developing
a
definition
that
would
accommodate
changes
in
publishing
practices
from
the
manuscript
book
period
to
the
present
day
they
comment
that
while
the
most
familiar
form
of
publishing
is
commercial
models
of
publishing
that
are
not
driven
by
profit
have
existed
from
the
rise
of
the
western
manuscript
book
trade
forward
they
give
as
examples
the
publishing
activities
of
governments
religious
institutions
and
individuals
supported
by
patronage
the
adamsbarker
definition
of
publishing
focuses
on
the
initial
decision
to
multiply
a
text
or
image
for
distribution
adamsbarker
p
and
identifies
four
roles
involved
in
this
decision
author
financier
manufacturer
and
distributor
which
in
any
given
period
of
time
might
be
performed
by
distinct
parties
or
might
be
done
in
any
combination
the
adamsbarker
model
also
depicts
five
events
in
the
life
of
a
book
publication
manufacture
distribution
reception
and
survival
these
events
are
conceptualized
as
occurring
within
the
context
of
what
they
call
the
socioeconomic
conjecture
including
commercial
pressures
intellectual
legal
and
religious
influences
and
the
realms
of
social
behavior
and
taste
a
diachronic
definition
of
publishing
i
e
a
definition
that
is
generic
enough
to
encompass
the
study
of
book
publishing
as
it
changes
over
time
is
ideally
suited
to
an
examination
of
the
changes
that
are
occurring
in
the
patterns
and
practices
with
which
books
today
come
into
being
as
objects
are
made
publicly
available
are
discovered
by
potential
audiences
read
or
not
read
and
survive
or
do
not
survive
in
this
paper
we
propose
what
we
intend
as
a
friendly
amendment
to
adamsbarker
for
our
purposes
a
book
publisher
is
an
individual
or
a
collective
that
makes
the
initial
decisions
and
arrangements
for
multiple
copies
of
books
to
be
publicly
available
for
distribution
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
definition
while
we
believe
it
gets
at
the
essential
activity
underlying
the
diachronic
practice
of
book
publishing
does
not
require
features
of
the
publishing
practices
we
know
best
from
the
twentieth
century
such
as
commercial
mainstream
publishing
companies
with
large
financial
investment
for
manufacture
tight
gate
keeping
of
published
material
a
body
of
book
writing
and
publishing
expertise
interpreted
and
enforced
by
editors
and
publishers
consolidated
distribution
and
above
all
print
format
all
these
features
certainly
still
exist
in
publishing
and
arguably
still
dominate
but
by
using
a
definition
that
does
not
require
these
features
we
can
not
only
see
continuity
with
publishing
from
the
manuscript
book
forward
but
we
are
more
likely
to
see
changes
that
are
emerging
in
the
technological
economic
and
sociocultural
world
of
networking
as
currently
instantiated
on
the
internet
in
addition
to
their
diachronic
definition
of
book
publishing
the
theoretical
context
of
adams
and
barkers
work
including
the
identification
of
historically
shifting
roles
and
the
socioeconomic
conjecture
in
which
they
situate
the
activities
and
technologies
that
comprise
the
events
in
the
lives
of
books
shapes
our
thinking
in
this
study
the
focus
of
this
study
is
book
publishing
although
the
diachronic
definition
of
publishing
above
can
be
applied
to
other
types
of
content
for
our
purposes
we
have
defined
a
book
loosely
as
any
publication
of
monographic
length
with
a
sustained
narrative
or
argument
either
textual
or
visual
or
in
combination
and
some
familial
relationship
to
the
genre
we
know
as
the
printed
book
including
some
combination
author
chapters
tables
of
contents
isbn
number
and
other
resemblances
methodology
the
methodology
for
this
work
was
to
study
a
purposive
sample
of
book
publishers
that
fit
our
definitional
framework
continuing
to
search
until
we
were
not
retrieving
examples
that
seemed
new
in
significant
ways
our
final
sample
which
we
call
emerging
publishers
is
just
under
publishers
given
the
enormity
and
constantly
changing
nature
of
the
internet
this
is
obviously
not
a
complete
universe
we
also
chose
not
to
examine
print
publishers
who
did
not
use
themselves
use
the
internet
for
distribution
and
sales
of
books
although
many
of
these
publishers
works
are
available
through
the
distributors
and
aggregators
that
were
included
the
ways
that
digital
technologies
are
changing
traditional
print
publishing
practices
excluding
electronic
books
have
been
documented
thoroughly
by
john
thompson
in
books
in
the
digital
age
those
traditional
publishers
who
are
experimenting
with
the
emerging
publishing
environment
on
the
internet
are
represented
well
in
our
sample
categorical
analysis
our
goal
was
to
organize
our
sample
around
categories
whose
characteristics
call
attention
to
key
differences
among
our
publishers
and
their
activities
the
categories
were
not
intended
to
be
mutually
exclusive
but
to
highlight
both
shared
characteristics
and
some
different
patterns
within
categories
after
much
experimentation
we
identified
three
types
of
publishing
agent
two
who
make
the
initial
decision
and
arrangements
to
publish
and
a
third
category
used
by
both
types
of
primary
publishers
for
publishing
arrangements
the
first
category
book
publishing
entities
was
defined
as
entities
or
individuals
functioning
as
entities
who
make
initial
decisions
to
make
books
from
multiple
authors
publicly
available
the
second
category
authors
as
publishers
was
defined
as
authors
themselves
making
the
initial
decision
to
publish
their
own
work
the
third
category
was
defined
as
groups
that
assist
publishers
of
both
types
with
a
combination
of
publishing
roles
this
group
was
labeled
channels
to
market
following
increasingly
common
usage
among
sites
studied
categories
were
then
subdivided
again
along
common
characteristics
the
intention
is
not
to
make
a
rigid
classification
scheme
but
to
highlight
distinctions
in
a
systematic
way
table
i
categories
of
emerging
publishers
our
descriptions
of
these
categories
in
the
text
below
follow
roughly
the
same
pattern
a
label
and
definition
that
attempts
to
capture
defining
feature
of
each
category
a
description
of
common
characteristics
and
then
a
brief
discussion
of
a
handful
of
examples
that
illustrate
either
characteristic
or
distinctive
features
within
a
category
tables
accompanying
each
discussion
show
the
publishers
in
each
category
at
the
end
of
the
descriptions
of
categories
we
bring
together
some
observations
about
shifts
in
book
publication
practices
resulting
from
the
analysis
of
the
sample
across
categories
category
i
book
publishing
entities
this
category
comprises
entities
who
make
the
initial
decisions
for
making
multiple
copies
of
books
from
multiple
authors
publicly
available
most
of
these
entities
appear
to
be
commercial
forprofit
companies
it
is
useful
to
think
of
these
publishers
in
two
groups
i
those
whose
primary
production
of
books
is
print
and
who
then
may
make
decisions
to
distribute
electronically
and
i
those
whose
primary
production
of
books
is
electronic
and
who
then
may
make
decisions
to
distribute
in
print
pod
format
publishers
of
bornprint
ebooks
the
key
characteristic
highlighted
by
this
category
is
the
electronic
offering
of
books
that
first
appeared
in
print
our
sample
includes
fifteen
print
publishers
with
substantial
electronic
distribution
announced
on
their
sites
by
no
means
all
that
exist
but
enough
of
a
variety
to
show
some
common
characteristics
and
some
different
arrangements
as
with
bornprint
ejournals
born
print
ebooks
bring
with
them
all
the
standard
valueadded
services
of
a
print
publisher
they
are
simply
distributed
electronically
format
of
distribution
and
availability
along
with
related
changes
in
discovery
mechanisms
are
features
distinguishing
this
category
of
electronic
publisher
in
other
respects
they
follow
commercial
print
publishers
publishing
practices
including
the
acquisition
and
preparation
of
manuscripts
and
the
compensation
of
authors
having
said
that
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
pressures
and
competition
of
the
emerging
publishers
discussed
below
will
over
time
change
more
print
publishing
practices
as
it
is
clearly
influencing
distribution
and
marketing

some
argue
that
the

rather
than
an
aversion
to

a

either

practices
of
these
emerging
publishers
are
similar
to
patterns
from
commercial
print
publishing
it
is
important
to
recognize
ways
in
which
these
emerging
publishers
are
pushing
the
traditional
boundaries
of
publishing
established
in
the
print
world
content
is
one
of
the
most
obvious
differences
fiction
and
particularly
romance
and
other
genre
fiction
dominated
our
sample
although
nonfiction
was
available
imprints
or
series
with
specific
characteristics
are
frequently
used
to
direct
niche
audiences
to
their
work
the
categorical
lists
which
comprise
the
primary
subject
finding
tool
for
all
categories
of
publishers
show
some
categories
that
arguably
have
not
been
well
represented
across
print
publishing
such
as
erotica
dark
fantasy
and
others
lower
entry
costs
for
these
publishers
compared
to
traditional
print
publishing
may
account
for
the
flourishing
of
niche
publishing
publishers
and
imprints
within
publishers
that
are
targeted
to
specific
and
frequently
nonmainstream
audiences

category
ii
author
as
publisher
the
second
category
highlights
the
author
acting
as
publisher
the
person
who
makes
the
initial
decisions
and
arrangements
to
make
multiple
copies
available
for
public
distribution
digital
technologies
have
opened
many
new
avenues
for
authors
to
create
books
and
make
them
publicly
available
and
authors
are
using
them
in
great
numbers
to
provide
an
overview
of
the
burgeoning
world
of
authors
as
publishers
we
have
organized
these
efforts
in
three
subcategories
these
categories
even
more
than
the
ones
introduced
previously
are
an
oversimplification
of
the
great
variety
that
exists
in
these
efforts
but
they
have
the
virtue
of
bringing
some
order
to
an
examination
of
this
phenomenon
the
three
categories
examined
here
are
authors
using
feebased
commercial
services
authors
using
automated
websites
designed
for
uploading
books
and
authors
providing
their
own
web
infrastructure
for
making
their
work
available
and
sometimes
sharing
their
space
with
other
authors
authors
using
feebased
publishing
services
adams
and
barker
point
out
that
authors
arranging
for
the
publishing
of
their
own
work
often
with
the
assistance
of
patronage
has
a
long
history
in
the
twentieth
century
authorfinanced
publishing
carried
the
pejorative
title
of
vanity
publishing
with
the
implied
assumption
that
if
authors
were
any
good
they
would
not
have
to
finance
the
publication
of
their
own
works
authors
who
arranged
for
the
manufacture
of
their
own
printed
books
faced
major
obstacles
in
distributing
them
in
the
preinternet
print
book
world
distribution
of
books
was
in
the
hands
of
a
few
wholesalers
who
supplied
retailers
libraries
and
schools
amazon
pioneered
the
channel
to
market
approach
on
the
internet
providing
for
the
discovery
distribution
and
sales
of
print
titles
soon
expanded
to
media
and
other
commodities
and
thus
breaking
up
the
distribution
bottleneck
in
early
january
the
associated
press
distributed
an
article
by
candace
choi
got
a
manuscript
publishing
now
a
snap
highlighting
the
skyrocketing
use
by
authors
of
feebased
commercial
publishing
services
our
searching
identified
over
fifty
of
these
services
of
which
lulu
com
amazons
createspace
and
blurb
com
were
featured
by
choi
the
basic
idea
behind
these
services
is
that
authors
can
purchase
publishing
infrastructure
manufacturing
distribution
and
marketing
services
previously
provided
for
free
by
print
publishers
for
their
selected
authors
shifting
both
the
decision
to
publish
and
the
financial
burden
to
the
author
but
giving
them
opportunities
to
reach
audiences
previously
dominated
by
commercial
companies
while
the
main
thrust
of
most
services
is
to
provide
print
books
many
provide
electronic
distribution
as
well
two
examples
of
feebased
publishing
services
will
be
discussed
iuniverse
and
amazons
createspace
iuniverse
is
a
useful
example
to
describe
briefly
because
they
have
organized
their
services
into
packages
ranging
from
under
to
under
with
addons
in
all
categories
the
most
inexpensive
option
is
most
like
traditional
vanity
publishing
of
the
past
providing
the
author
with
professionally
manufactured
pod
print
copies
for
family
and
friends
with
the
added
limited
distribution
mechanism
of
availability
through
the
iuniverse
book
store
increasingly
expensive
options
provide
more
professional
quality
and
services
and
increasingly
wide
retail
availability
through
channels
to
market
such
as
barnes
and
noble
com
amazon
and
many
others
the
highend
services
provide
the
essentials
of
commercial
print
publishing
including
marketing
efforts
such
as
the
distribution
of
review
copies
amazons
createspace
calls
itself
on
demand
publishing
they
manufacture
and
sell
physical
objects
including
pod
books
audio
books
audio
cds
video
cds
and
other
products
one
at
a
time
as
ordered
the
price
is
set
by
the
author
and
royalties
are
paid
to
the
author
as
they
are
generated
by
sales
the
author
or
creator
is
entirely
responsible
for
the
content
which
is
uploaded
to
createspace
for
production
createspace
products
are
sold
via
amazon
while
theoretically
the
consumer
can
identify
a
selfpublished
book
by
recognizing
the
publisher
the
increasing
number
of
these
services
plus
the
increasing
mix
on
channel
to
market
sites
of
commercial
publishers
traditionally
printed
books
and
emerging
publishers
of
pod
books
and
electronic
books
of
many
varieties
means
that
in
practice
the
distinction
between
commercial
publication
and
authorsubsidized
publication
is
increasingly
blurred

the
term
increasingly
used
to
represent
the
combination
of
manufacture
distribution
discovery
and

that
is
flourishing
on

in
the
preinternet

world
distribution
of

was
tightly

by
a
few

who
supplied

from
multiple
publishers
to
sellers
and
institutions
such
as
schools
and

of

was
accomplished
primarily
through
publishers
advertising
and
marketing
reviews
compendia
such
as

amazon
pioneered
the

concept

initially
we
had
classified

as
a
secondary

along
with

borndigital
publishers
of
electronic

however
toward
the
end
of
our
analysis
we
put
them
in
their
own

because
of
the
increasing
tendency
of
both
commercial
publishers
and
authors
who
use
publishing

to
be
combined
in

it

observations
about
shifts
in
book
publishing
practices
in
the
age
of
networking
a
number
of
observations
can
be
made
about
emerging
shifts
in
publishing
practices
by
looking
across
the
categories
analyzed
above
many
of
these
observations
are
not
new
to
this
paper
but
they
have
arisen
here
from
empirical
examination
of
a
large
number
of
instances
and
therefore
they
provide
some
evidence
toward
validation
of
these
shifts
formats
while
it
is
startlingly
clear
that
the
appearance
of
books
in
electronic
format
either
bornprint
or
borndigital
and
indeed
the
burgeoning
number
of
new
borndigital
publishers
is
a
major
phenomenon
occurring
on
the
internet
focusing
only
on
electronic
books
masks
the
reality
that
reformatting
goes
in
numerous
directions
certainly
from
print
to
various
electronic
forms
but
also
to
audio
books
and
from
digital
to
print
enabled
by
pod
the
growing
quality
and
popularity
of
pod
and
its
growing
transparent
use
by
publishers
either
directly
or
through
services
like
lightningsource
and
channels
to
market
like
amazon
is
increasing
the
number
of
print
titles
available
and
diluting
at
least
the
traditional
notion
of
the
technological
origins
of
a
printed
book
and
arguably
the
traditional
printpublisher
based
notion
of
the
book
itself
the
popularity
of
pod
print
copies
for
authors
publishing
their
work
through
publishing
services
also
illustrates
that
the
flow
of
formats
is
complex
some
channels
to
market
offer
format
as
a
consumer
choice
and
one
may
speculate
that
that
trend
may
continue
commercial
channels
now
exist
for
the
direct
ordering
of
pod
books
by
libraries
schools
and
retailers
although
the
extent
of
their
use
is
not
clear
the
impact
of
pod
on
book
publishing
is
we
believe
in
its
infancy
and
will
have
possibly
as
dramatic
a
change
on
publishing
patterns
and
practices
as
electronic
books
are
having
now
shifts
in
publishing
roles
our
theoretical
model
arose
out
of
notion
that
component
roles
of
publishing
have
shifted
over
historical
time
from
the
rise
of
the
western
book
and
has
directed
our
attention
to
dimensions
of
these
shifts
now
occurring
in
the
technological
economic
and
sociocultural
environment
of
the
internet
a
central
result
of
using
the
amended
adamsbarker
definition
of
a
publisher
was
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
extent
to
which
authors
can
act
and
are
acting
as
their
own
publishers
and
making
available
a
wide
variety
of
books
from
products
that
can
not
be
distinguished
from
the
products
of
traditional
publishers
in
appearance
and
arguably
in
quality
to
incomplete
informal
and
unfinished
explorations
in
writing
books
another
central
recognition
for
us
was
the
extent
to
which
traditional
publishers
patterns
and
roles
in
manufacturer
distribution
and
sales
are
changing
the
rise
of
channel
to
market
services
which
offer
remanufacture
reformatting
multipleformat
distribution
directly
to
customers
or
through
third
parties
and
new
marketing
approaches
through
interaction
with
authors
and
readers
while
not
eliminating
publishers
decisionmaking
certainly
tends
toward
uncoupling
or
expanding
functions
that
were
once
directly
controlled
by
publishers
standards
of
publishing
practice
andrew
keen
author
of
cult
of
the
amateur
how
the
internet
is
killing
our
culture
is
just
one
of
many
voices
who
are
concerned
about
the
loosening
of
standards
in
publication
and
public
discourse
increasingly
the
fact
of
publication
is
not
a
promise
to
the
reader
that
the
book
has
been
vetted
by
the
writing
and
editing
professional
elite
who
have
dominated
print
publication
although
many
publishing
services
either
offer
or
recommend
the
services
of
feebased
publishing
professionals
the
emergence
of
niche
publishing
especially
in
areas
that
have
not
been
well
represented
in
mainstream
publishing
either
because
of
small
market
size
or
some
form
of
stigmatization
in
mainstream
society
can
also
be
seen
as
a
loosening
of
the
gate
keeping
role
of
mainstream
publishing
in
determining
the
body
of
book
content
available
to
the
public
not
everyone
decries
this
increasing
inclusion
of
previously
excluded
content
both
in
substance
and
style
but
the
effects
on
society
are
certainly
being
vigorously
debated
costs
many
changes
are
occurring
in
the
cost
structure
of
book
publishing
which
this
study
only
hints
at
it
seems
highly
likely
that
arguably
lower
entry
costs
for
publication
of
electronic
books
foster
the
expansion
of
electronic
publishers
that
seems
to
be
occurring
we
have
heard
some
evidence
that
the
number
of
new
print
book
publishers
is
growing
due
in
large
part
to
lower
entry
costs
through
pod
services
but
that
needs
confirming
certainly
the
cost
of
distribution
and
reaching
markets
is
being
redistributed
not
only
in
electronic
publication
but
in
traditional
print
publishing
as
marketing
support
of
publishers
of
all
kinds
shifts
we
have
not
seen
a
definitive
study
of
the
costs
to
the
consumer
of
electronic
books
the
received
wisdom
is
that
costs
of
electronic
books
are
lower
but
that
needs
systematic
documentation
although
this
study
uncovered
numerous
examples
of
authors
who
are
distributing
their
work
for
free
the
motivations
are
not
clearly
understood
surely
readership
and
recognition
is
in
the
mix
but
the
extent
to
which
authors
see
subsidized
publication
and
free
distribution
as
a
path
to
recognition
by
a
traditional
print
publisher
is
uncertain
certainly
well
publicized
examples
exist
but
how
frequently
they
occur
and
how
they
affect
the
motivation
for
an
author
to
self
publish
is
in
our
minds
still
unclear
discovery
readership
and
reception
and
survival
in
this
arena
there
are
even
more
unanswered
questions
than
in
the
areas
above
in
the
long
tail
chris
anderson
has
extensively
documented
the
shift
from
scarce
resources
in
all
media
to
abundance
and
the
presence
of
many
niche
products
and
markets
and
he
has
suggested
that
in
an
environment
of
abundance
and
small
niche
markets
the
readers
ability
to
discover
titles
of
potential
interest
to
them
is
crucial
anderson
channels
to
market
play
an
important
role
in
discovery
primarily
through
the
creation
of
genre
lists
and
search
strategies
increasingly
commercial
publishers
authors
channel
sites
and
niche
interest
sites
of
many
varieties
are
experimenting
with
social
forms
of
book
discovery
reviews
recommendations
blogs
tagging
and
other
ways
of
sharing
with
likeminded
people
in
the
romance
arena
for
example
reviews
on
popular
sites
like
coffee
time
romance
or
romance
junkies
cover
print
and
electronic
books
in
niche
markets
as
well
as
mainstream
ones
an
obvious
question
to
ask
in
view
of
the
increasingly
abundant
supply
of
books
is
whether
they
are
finding
readers
andersons
argument
in
terms
of
economics
is
that
a
large
number
of
small
purchases
in
the
long
tail
can
be
economically
viable
perhaps
implied
in
that
assertion
is
some
restructuring
or
shifting
of
economic
models
of
publishers
and
channels
to
market
another
question
begging
for
hard
data
is
how
much
electronic
books
from
whatever
publishing
source
are
being
purchased
or
borrowed
and
read
survival
of
electronic
and
indeed
pod
books
is
also
a
issue
that
raises
more
questions
than
answers
as
in
all
areas
of
digital
preservation
john
b
thompson
documents
the
struggles
of
publishers
to
shift
from
the
mindset
that
their
chief
asset
is
a
published
book
in
a
warehouse
to
understanding
their
assets
as
electronic
files
saved
and
available
in
reformatable
condition
and
the
debates
around
the
preservation
of
ejournals
in
an
environment
where
access
has
shifted
from
ownership
to
licensing
under
restricted
conditions
can
be
extended
to
electronic
books
as
can
the
ongoing
conversations
of
the
longterm
viability
of
todays
electronic
formats
future
directions
this
study
is
our
initial
look
at
shifts
in
publishing
practices
in
the
age
of
the
internet
and
raises
many
more
questions
than
it
answers
each
of
the
observations
above
and
others
needs
to
be
probed
in
greater
detail
datadriven
