abstract
professional
education
in
information
schools
is
predominantly
technical
and
based
on
a
rational
scientific
way
of
thinking
about
the
world
in
this
essay
we
make
the
argument
that
experience
and
interaction
with
the
arts
aesthetic
experience
should
play
an
important
role
in
the
education
of
information
professionals
our
discussion
of
the
role
of
the
arts
in
an
ischool
education
is
structured
around
three
basic
ideas
first
we
argue
that
the
arts
offer
a
pathway
into
complementary
mode
of
thinking
and
knowing
that
is
not
only
highly
beneficial
for
the
technical
professions
but
may
also
be
important
for
the
development
of
a
competitive
future
work
force
we
refer
to
this
as
an
artistic
mode
of
knowing
and
we
discuss
both
terminology
and
the
characteristics
in
this
section
second
we
build
on
the
ideas
of
grant
and
others
that
focus
on
the
organizational
and
societal
importance
of
collaboration
among
individuals
with
diverse
specialized
knowledge
we
describe
how
the
skills
needed
for
successful
interdisciplinary
collaboration
are
increasingly
drawing
on
both
ways
of
knowing
third
we
argue
that
much
of
the
work
done
by
information
professionals
has
more
in
common
than
would
first
appear
with
the
work
done
by
design
professionals
and
creative
and
performing
artists
and
thus
is
amenable
to
the
pedagogical
techniques
employed
in
those
fields
we
conclude
by
offering
specific
ischool
examples
of
artsbased
pedagogy
and

suggestions
for

these
ideas

and
necessary

to
the
more

that
currently

professional
education
in
information
schools
is
predominantly
technical
and
based
on
a
rational
scientific
way
of
thinking
about
the
world
our
students
learn
the
skills
required
for
effective
librarianship
information
systems
development
and
network
administration
among
others
and
it
is
entirely
appropriate
that
the
primary
focus
of
a
professional
education
be
on
the
technical
knowledge
and
skill
that
professionals
must
master
but
beyond
technical
competence
successful
professionals
also
require
the
ability
to
interpret
complex
and
ambiguous
situations
interact
with
those
expert
in
other
forms
of
specialized
knowledge
and
constructively
evaluate
their
own
work
and
the
work
of
others
these
abilities
call
for
an
approach
to
knowing
the
world
that
complements
the
knowledge
provided
by
a
rational
scientific
approach
this
approach
to
knowing
is
characterized
by
intuitive
understanding
emotional
sensitivity
catharsis
metaphor
and
analogy
bruner
proposes
that
the
experience
of
art
promotes
an
integrated
holistic
view
of
phenomena
that
is
a
useful
complement

analytic

we
explore
these
three
assertions
in
detail
in
sections
and
of
this
paper
in
section
we
offer
a
specific
ischool
example
of
artsbased
pedagogy
and
include
suggestions
for
incorporating
these
ideas
into
an
existing
curriculum
scientific
and
artistic
modes
of
knowing
for
the
past
two
centuries
specialized
technical
workers
have
relied
on
an
approach
to
thinking
and
knowing
derived
from
the
scientific
method
of
acquiring
knowledge
this
scientific
approach
has
resulted
in
valuable
technology
that
has
allowed
us
to
produce
complex
and
sophisticated
tools
it
has
created
improvements
in
health
prosperity
and
standard
of
living
that
are
unprecedented
in
human
history
however
the
unintended
side
effects
of
our
technological
revolution
e
g
potential
for
mass
destruction
climate
change
etc
make
it
clear
that
the
ability
to
use
technology
effectively
does
not
necessarily
evolve
directly
from
the
scientific
approach
to
knowing
that
allows
us
to
make
technology
in
this
section
we
briefly
sketch
the
outlines
of
an
approach
to
thinking
knowing
and
understanding
that
we
believe
can
serve
as
a
highly
useful
complement
to
the
scientific
approach
to
gaining
knowledge
we
label
this
approach
the
artistic
mode
of
knowing
in
order
to
emphasize
its
distinctness
from
the
scientific
approach
but
we
recognize
that
the
label
has
the
potential
to
mislead
the
two
ways
of
knowing
we
consider
do
not
represent
a
pure
dichotomy
but
rather
lie
on
a
continuum
with
most
thinking
and
knowing
taking
place
somewhere
in
the
middle
and
employing
both
modes
in
varying
degrees
our
objective
is
to
promote
a
mode
of
thinking
and
knowing
that
operates
in
terms
of
a
bothand
opportunity
rather
than
an
eitheror
choice
art
historian
james
elkins
is
promoting
a
similarly
holistic
approach
in
his
book
entitled
the
domain
of
images
where
he
makes
an
argument
for
an
inclusive
study
of
images
both
those
deemed
as
art
and
those
seen
as
more
utilitarian
such
as
images
used
in
science
in
fact
he
devotes
several
pages
to
discussing
the
inadequacy
of
many
if
not
all
artnonart
monikers
examining
and
ultimately
finding
fault
with
a
range
of
terms
for
nonart
images
including
scientific
nonreligious
inexpressive
non
or
extraaesthetic
utilitarian
informational
nonrepresentational
schematic
and
notational
ultimately
he
finds
a
distinction
based
on
practice
to
be
the
most
useful
for
his
purposes
art
images
are
those
generally
studied
by
art
historians
nonart
images
are
not
we
have
followed
a
similarly
pragmatic
approach
to
clarifying
our
distinction
between
artistic
and
scientific
ways
of
knowing
and
thinking
about
problems
while
we
continue
to
search
for
the
perfect
terms
for
these
two
modes
we
will
let
these
terms
stand
for
the
moment
and
move
on
to
describe
in
more
detail
what
each
represent
in
terms
of
this
research
we
begin
by
presenting
in
bullet
form
a
series
of
distinctions
between
the
two
modes
of
knowing
and
thinking
scientific
thinking
discriminates
between
and
analyzes
details
artistic
thinking
synthesizes
details
into
a
single
holistic
pattern
scientific
knowing
focuses
on
category
artistic
knowing
focuses
on
relationship
scientific
knowing
relies
on
analysis
artistic
knowing
relies
on
synthesis
scientific
knowing
segregates
artistic
knowing
integrates
scientific
knowing
is
sequential
literal
functional
textual
and
analytic
artistic
knowing
is
simultaneous
metaphorical
aesthetic
contextual
and
synthetic
there
is
a
persistent
but
disconnected
stream
of
research
and
argument
that
supports
the
need
for
a
mode
of
thinking
and
knowing
to
complement
the
scientific
model
that
dominates
professional
higher
education
for
example
there
is
growing
collection
of
literature
that
recognizes
the
importance
of
arming
management
students
with
a
broader
range
of
skills
in
order
to
ensure
success
in
a
competitive
market
business
school
educators
are
looking
to
the
liberal
arts
in
order
to
bridge
the
gaps
in
information
system
education
related
to
peopleskills
the
american
assembly
of
collegiate
schools
of
business
aacsb
has
specifically
advocated
the
integration
of
liberal
arts
education
into
the
business
curriculum
researchers
have
also
begun
to
explore
the
aesthetic
dimension
of
information
systems
design
for
example
tractinsky
writes
of
the
aesthetics
of
the
information
system
design
object
by
aesthetics
he
means
the
common
every
day
meeting
of
the
term
an
artistically
beautiful
or
pleasing
appearance
he
notes
that
research
in
information
systems
has
almost
completely
ignored
this
notion
of
aesthetics
in
order
to
focus
on
robustness
and
functionality
and
speculates
that
this
might
be
because
the
origins
of
the
computing
disciplines
emphasize
the
rational
model
of
hard
science
efficiency
and
utility
as
information
systems
become
more
interactive
and
place
more
emphasis
on
visual
displays
he
argues
that
visual
aesthetics
should
receive
more
research
and
pedagogical
attention
for
several
reasons
first
as
science
and
technology
provide
products
that
dramatically
exceed
the
functional
needs
of
most
humans
the
aesthetic
dimension
becomes
more
important
second
aesthetic
interpretations
and
evaluations
are
often
hard
to
overcome
because
they
precede
and
influence
reflective
and
cognitive
interpretations
finally
he
argues
that
while
some
aesthetic
responses
are
innate
and
relatively
invariant
most
are
learned
and
depend
on
culture
education
and
other
experiences
because
they
are
acquired
we
should
focus
on
their
education
bennett
et
al
writing
from
a
business
management
perspective
note
the
research
from
cognitive
psychology
and
organizational
cognition
that
describes
human
limitations
in
the
ability
to
understand
and
represent
ambiguous
concepts
and
situations
this
focus
on
the
bounded
rationality
of
human
problem
solvers
reminds
us
of
the
importance
of
being
able
to
interpretand
evaluate
complex
ambiguous
situations
holistically
by
using
tools
other
then
those
that
are
rational
and
analytical
because
human
rationality
is
bounded
or
limited
an
aesthetic
way
of
approaching
complex
ambiguous
situations
may
provide
a
number
of
benefits
including
the
ability
to
usefully
integrate
information
that
at
first
appears
to
be
fragmented
unrelated
and
thus
ambiguous
aesthetic
understanding
can
help
information
professionals
coherently
interpret
ambiguous
situations
by
illuminating
the
correspondences
and
relationships
within
them
in
other
discussions
on
how
to
prepare
college
graduates
for
future
professional
jobs
the
argument
has
often
been
made
that
todays
market
requires
graduates
to
possess
cross
functional
skills
beyond
those
related
to
a
specific
professional
expertise
e
g
businesshigher
education
forum
bhef
such
skills
transcend
professional
job
categories
and
are
often
missing
in
college
graduates
the
crossfunctional
competencies
frequently
identified
are
leadership
teamwork
problem
solving
critical
thinking
global
consciousness
tolerance
for
ambiguity
and
basic
communication
skills
listening
speaking
reading
and
writing
the
need
for
these
skills
is
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
the
us
department
of
education
is
forecasting
a
shortage
of
collegeeducated
workers
in
united
states
of
more
than
million
by
the
year
the
nation
is
on
the
verge
of
a
critical
shortage
of
workers
with
collegelevel
skills
the
report
calls
for
the
united
states
to
create
a
nation
of
learners
innovative
initiatives
many
of
these
opportunities
involve
working
with
colleagues
in
disciplines
closely
aligned
with
the
information
field
such
as
computer
science
and
business
however
many
are
bringing
us
in
contact
with
partners
from
the
humanities
additionally
we
have
observed
that
many
of
the
work
environments
our
students
are
entering
upon
leaving
our
school
are
increasingly
driven
by
diverse
teams
that
include
members
from
a
range
of
technology
design
and
marketing
fields
the
longevity
of
this
trend
is
supported
by
grants
argument
that
organizations
exist
to
provide
integrating
routines
that
allow
individuals
with
diverse
specialized
knowledge
to
collaborate
effectively
the
report
argues
that
the
united
states
competitive
position
in
the
world
depends
on
its
ability
to
educate
a
sufficient
number
of
workers
who
are
able
to
interpret
complex
and
ambiguous
situations
solve
problems
communicate
and
lead
to
accomplish
this
the
nation
needs
major
investments
and
major
changes
in
the
models
of
higher
education
that
are
used
to
prepare
students
for
the
job
market
learning
to
participate
in
successful
collaborations
involves
gaining
socalled
people
skills
including
developing
methods
for
resolving
conflict
and
acquiring
the
ability
to
articulate
and
defend
ones
own
ideas
to
people
not
necessarily
sharing
the
same
background
or
vocabulary
exposure
to
the
arts
as
a
complement
to
technical
training
can
give
our
students
great
advantage
in
these
areas
education
in
the
arts
including
literature
fine
art
and
music
often
focuses
on
developing
tools
of
empathy
increasing
awareness
of
the
diversity
of
the
human
experience
honing
methods
for
reading
subtext
and
nuanced
meaning
and
cultivating
an
ability
to
interpret
ambiguity
from
a
number
of
vantage
points
we
propose
that
an
arts
based
approach
to
professional
education
can
provide
one
such
alternative
model
engagement
with
the
arts
as
a
method
for
gaining
understanding
can
help
to
address
this
gap
bruner
identifies
four
aspects
of
the
experience
of
art
that
hint
at
the
potential
benefits
of
this
approach
connectedness
interaction
with
the
arts
can
generate
a
synthetic
response
that
helps
one
bridge
the
gaps
between
seemingly
disconnected
experiences
in
order
to
discover
a
cohesive
view
of
the
world
effort
interaction
with
the
arts
requires
work
work
that
often
demands
departing
from
habitual
and
literal
ways
of
looking
at
things
conversion
of
impulse
art
can
provide
boundaries
and
forums
for
the
experience
of
seemingly
uncontrollable
instincts
or
impulses
thus
allowing
for
their
exploration
and
understanding
in
ways
that
would
be
otherwise
proscribed
or
inhibited
generality
interaction
with
the
arts
often
creates
a
shock
of
recognition
that
provides
an
expanded
view
of
the
known
these
forms
of
understanding
involve
comprehending
at
a
deep
level
in
ways
that
lie
outside
the
linear
analytic
mode
of
scientific
method
by
providing
opportunities
to
students
that
will
allow
them
to
experience
these
dimensions
of
knowledge
we
can
enable
them
to
more
successfully
tackle
socially
complex
and
ambiguous
problems
these
are
precisely
the
types
of
problems
that
they
will
likely
encounter
in
the
real
world
of
organizational
life
the
arts
and
interdisciplinary
collaboration
our
second
argument
stems
directly
from
increasingly
frequent
opportunities
we
see
at
the
ischool
at
syracuse
university
occasions
for
interdisciplinary
collaborations
within
the
school
within
the
university
and
across
the
wider
academic
community
as
well
as
potential
partnerships
with
industry
are
springing
up
with
great
regularity
these
opportunities
cast
a
spotlight
on
the
need
to
provide
our
students
with
a
diverse
set
of
problemsolving
tools
to
help
them
build
a
strong
and
flexible
set
of
critical
thinking
skills
that
will
enable
them
to
take
part
in
these
all
of
these
skills
are
desirable
if
not
in
fact
necessary
in
collaborative
work
groups
specifically
as
we
will
discuss
further
exposure
to
a
studio
art
working
and
learning
environment
provides
students
with
the
opportunity
to
explore
diverse
expressions
and
creative
solutions
in
a
group
setting
when
these
situations
bear
the
most
fruitful
results
students
struggle
through
their
own
attempt
to
express
themselves
while
simultaneously
interpreting
and
evaluating
the
work
of
their
peers
the
interdependence
of
studio
cohort
members
can
become
one
of
the
most
generative
aspects
of
the
studio
art
experience
rich
stimuli
in
the
form
of
artistic
content
can
provoke
discussions
engineered
to
teach
intellectual
skills
and
studiobased
learning
can
provide
an
opportunity
to
try
out
these
new
intellectual
tools
in
a
handson
communal
environment
the
marriage
of
theory
and
practice
that
marks
much
artsbased
learning
has
the
potential
to
enhance
the
ability
our
students
to
work
successfully
in
collaborative
situations
we
reinforce
this
argument
by
presenting
two
concrete
examples
of
opportunities
for
collaboration
that
would
be
greatly
enhanced
by
providing
participating
students
with
exposure
to
the
types
of
skills
gained
through
experiences
with
the
arts
colleagues
at
the
ischool
at
syracure
have
been
advocating
the
creation
of
a
profession
devoted
specifically
to
the
support
role
that
information
professionals
play
in
enabling
people
to
make
the
most
of
new
technologies
referred
to
as
a
cyberinfrastructure
facilitator
one
of
the
main
responsibilities
of
this
position
is
to
advocate
for
and
enable
the
use
of
cyberbased
systems
tools
and
services
within
any
context
be
it
financial
services
education
the
arts
or
sciences
obviously
a
large
part
of
this
vision
is
ensuring
that
the
information
professional
has
adequate
communication
skills
and
a
full
understanding
of
the
needs
and
culture
of
the
community
that
he
or
she
is
serving
we
believe
that
artsbased
experiences
in
the
classroom
can
provide
students
with
a
forum
to
hone
these
skills
and
learn
how
to
process
diverse
perspectives
another
good
example
of
the
type
of
multidisciplinary
project
that
would
benefit
from
students
wellversed
in
artsinformed
learning
is
an

mcallister
director
of
innovation
and
design
at
the
school
of
art
and
design
within
the
college
of
visual
and
performing
arts
vpa
at
syracuse
he
is
advocating
for
the
creation
of
a
multimedia
design
center
on
campus
that
will
enable
students
to
get
handson
experience
solving
real
design
problems
within
the
syracuse
community
in
response
to
specific
needs
within
the
local
community
such
as
education
outreach
to
underrepresented
groups
within
the
city
and
small
businessentrepreneurial
startup
programs
students
will
propose
develop
and
importantly
implement
largescale
multimedia
projects
the
program
intends
to
bring
together
vpa
students
with
those
from
the
ischool
as
well
as
business
media
and
public
policy
areas
by
partnering
with
vpa
we
would
provide
our
students
with
the
chance
to
propose
facilitate
and
implement
technologydriven
solutions
to
an
array
of
real
world
information
problems
the
contributions
that
our
information
students
could
make
to
these
projects
are
significant
not
to
mention
the
value
that
they
would
get
from
participating
but
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
these
experiences
we
need
to
make
sure
that
we
are
teaching
them
the
skills
necessary
to
communicate
and
function
within
these
diverse
teams
we
should
not
neglect
our
responsibility
to
make
sure
our
students
are
properly
prepared
to
fully
participate
in
innovative
programs
like
this
both
while
they
are
here
at
the
ischool
and
after
they
graduate
in
fact
we
argue
that
many
of
the
skills
that
are
needed
to
take
full
advantage
of
opportunities
like
these
are
very
successfully
taught
by
utilizing
the
studiobased
approach
described
below
that
advocates
peer
interactions
critical
thinking
thoughtful
and
thoughtprovoking
experimentation
and
openness
to
alternative
solutions
these
are
also
the
same
skills
that
many
of
our
students
will
need
when
they
enter
the
work
force
and
find
themselves
working
in
multidisciplinary
teams
tackling
similar
problems
the
cycle
of
professional
work
our
third
argument
is
that
the
work
processes
of
technical
professionals
have
much
in
common
with
those
of
design
professionals
and
creative
and
performing
artists
as
a
result
pedagogical
approaches
that
have
been
found
effective
in
education
for
the
arts
can
also
have
a
role
in
the
education
of
iprofessionals
and
just
as
the
arts
are
becoming
increasingly
experimental
and
digital
so
also
are
the
information
professions
for
example
the
iprofessional
of
the
future
may
have
to
do
much
more
than
write
a
memo
a
report
or
make
a
standup
presentation
in
order
to
communicate
effectively
as
professional
communication
increasingly
gravitates
to
new
media
skills
for
professionals
may
come
to
rely
increasingly
on
what
we
refer
to
here
as
the
artistic
mode
of
knowing
and
thinking
while
organizations
strive
for
a
controlled
and
predictive
state
of
operation
they
also
demand
innovation
and
invention
as
a
means
to
increase
resources
and
ultimately
gain
advantage
by
recognizing
that
iprofessionals
require
the
ability
to
use
both
creative
thinking
and
scientific
rigor
when
confronting
challenges
a
technical
education
informed
by
artsbased
practice
can
benefit
both
individuals
and
organizations
generalizing
across
many
technical
professions
e
g
librarianship
information
systems
design
software
engineering
medicine
accounting
engineering
etc
figure
illustrates
four
generic
dimensions
of
professional
work
production
performance
interpretation
and
critique
technical
professionals
may
cycle
iteratively
through
all
fours
stages
in
projects
where
they
have
heavy
involvement
or
may
participate
in
one
or
two
stages
where
their
collaborative
contribution
is
more
peripheral
production
critique
performance
interpretation
figure
cycle
of
professional
work
production
includes
creation
of
professional
artifacts
software
engineers
write
programs
systems
analysts
and
engineers
create
designs
and
specifications
accountants
create
financial
statements
and
professional
workers
of
all
types
create
professional
correspondence
proposals
requests
for
proposals
reports
and
many
other
graphical
and
textual
artifacts
performance
in
the
iprofessions
includes
explicit
rolebased
activities
e
g
interviewing
to
elicit
requirements
by
reference
librarians
and
system
analysts
and
also
ubiquitous
performances
common
to
all
professional
worke
g
attendingconducting
meetings
interviews
presentations
etc
interpretation
occurs
whenever
professionals
are
called
upon
to
make
sense
of
ambiguous
situations
and
to
understand
what
is
going
on
in
times
of
uncertainty
each
technical
profession
has
its
own
set
of
analytical
tools
based
on
the
rational
scientific
model
to
assist
in
this
task
e
g
decision
trees
to
aid
physicians
in
diagnosis
representational
tools
used
by
systems
analysts
to
understand
and
model
systems
but
we
argue
that
the
rational
scientific
ways
of
knowing
that
each
profession
brings
to
its
field
of
focus
are
necessary
but
not
sufficient
when
interpretation
involves
complex
human
and
organizational
contexts
critique
involves
the
ongoing
professional
responsibility
to
evaluate
the
production
and
performance
of
self
and
others
and
to
make
judgments
about
the
professional
value
of
such
work
each
profession
has
developed
rational
tools
to
assist
in
this
process
of
evaluation
e
g
costbenefit
analysis
scoring
models
nevertheless
we
hear
again
and
again
that
such
evaluation
tools
are
not
always
sufficient
to
fully
evaluate
products
and
performances
in
situations
of
high
ambiguity
and
uncertainty
and
where
costs
and
benefits
are
strategic
or
less
tangible
it
is
perhaps
easier
to
see
the
commonalities
between
professional
and
artistic
production
and
performance
due
to
the
ubiquity
of
professional
artifacts
and
presentations
but
the
less
obvious
similarities
in
the
areas
of
interpretation
and
critique
may
prove
to
be
the
more
important
because
they
involve
skills
central
to
professional
judgment
skills
that
are
more
elusive
and
difficult
to
teach
applying
an
artsbased
approach
to
learning
in
ischools
at
this
point
we
introduce
a
practical
example
of
how
artsrelated
practices
can
be
integrated
into
an
existing
ischool
curriculum
we
divide
methods
for
incorporating
the
arts
into
ischool
pedagogy
into
two
categories
content
approaches
and
process
approaches
in
future
work
we
will
discuss
how
to
incorporate
arts
related
content
such
as
novels
poems
paintings
or
music
as
stimuli
for
discussion
into
professional
courses
examples
of
this
type
of
augmentation
to
standard
business
school
curricula
can
be
found
in
the
literature
for
this
paper
however
we
have
selected
a
processoriented
strategy
that
introduces
principles
of
studio
art
learning
into
a
technical
education
classroom
teaching
practices
commonly
used
in
studio
and
performancebased
pedagogy
can
unlock
a
broader
spectrum
of
experiences
for
ischool
students
without
compromising
other
aspects
of
their
education
in
fact
educators
in
a
range
of
professional
and
technical
fields
have
sought
to
make
use
of
studiobased
techniques
in
the
classroom
by
tapping
into
these
practices
ischool
educators
can
discover
new
methods
for
improving
people
skills
and
creating
more
flexible
thinkers
studio
learning
environments
focus
on
idea
generation
production
and
critique
it
is
common
for
problems
assigned
to
students
to
be
ambiguous
and
equivocal
a
student
is
expected
to
create
present
and
defend
their
work
in
front
of
the
class
the
class
is
then
expected
to
provide
thoughtful
and
constructive
criticism
to
help
improve
the
idea
during
discussion
and
evaluations
there
is
often
there
no
right
answer
students
take
turns
presenting
what
they
have
created
and
offering
critique
of
the
work
of
others
much
of
the
learning
is
done
out
in
the
open
within
a
setting
that
provides
a
shared
environment
for
mistakes
inventions
and
questions
this
setting
provides
students
with
opportunities
to
see
multiple
solutions
within
a
concentrated
timeframe
potential
solutions
can
be
evaluated
in
real
time
returning
to
the
cycle
of
professional
work
at
each
stage

as
an
example
of
how
a
studiobased
approach
can
be
applied
to
an
ischool
curriculum
we
present
an
adaptation
of
a
current
undergraduate
course
regularly
offered
by
our
school
ist
information
reporting
and

an
informal
survey
of
the
curricula
of
other
ischools
shows
that
many
include
a
similar
course
designed
to
introduce
students
to
basic
concepts
related
to
successfully
presenting
information
within
a
business
context
in
both
oral
and
printed
form
recognizing
the
sheer
volume
of
information
that
the
average
professional
handles
in
a
typical
work
environment
this
course
provides
students
with
tools
strategies
and
experience
in
making
presentations
with
skill
and
competence
the
course
is
designed
to
cover

we
have
reviewed
the

syllabus
and
identified
opportunities
to
align
this
class
with
the
four
stage
cycle
of
professional
work
presented
above
a
studiobased
iteration
of
the
course
as
described
below

be
piloted

might
follow
a
schedule
similar
to
the
one
shown
below
see
table
with
individual
and
group
presentations
occurring
throughout
the
semester
notably
the
course
is
designed
to
introduce
specific
key
concepts
and
provide
introductory
exposure
to
common
graphics
software
as
such
the
course
takes
a
linear
approaching
tackling
each
topic
in
sequence
the
cumulative
effect
for
students
is
exposure
to
all
of
the
objective
skills
and
techniques
related
to
information
presentation
and
reporting
the
ist
course
is
well
suited
to
incorporating
a
studiobased
approach
currently
students
work
in
small
groups
to
create
profiles
for
fictional
businesses
and
each
group
is
expected
to
generate
materials
for
their
company
during
the
course
of
the
semester
instruction
in
public
speaking
is
an
important
aspect
of
the
course

our
goal
in
redesigning
the

offerings
is
to
generate
a

that
iteratively

through
the
four

of

students

of
the
presentations

on
their
own
experiences
and
opinions
because
the
course
already
includes
a
degree
of
production
performance
and
critique
see
designations
table
our
focus
is
on
introducing
elements
related
to
interpretation
as
well
as
restructuring
course
content
to
reinforce
the
creative
cycle
that
underlies
much
studiobased
course
work
our
alternate
plan
for
the
course
based
on
a
studio
approach
covers
the
same
material
over
the
course
of
the
same
amount
of
time
and
exploits
the
power
of
repetition
and
iteration
that
is
common
to
studio
courses
instead
of
the
linear
format
shown
above
the
course
could
be
organized
as
a
series
of
iterative
cycles
stepping
students
through
the
work
cycle
multiple
times
and
while
increasing
exposure
to
skills
of
interpretation
such
a
course
might
look

while
the
specific
skills
and
exposure
to
software
are
virtually
the
same
as
the
more
traditional
linear
approach
the
iterative
cycle
allows
students
to
become
more
familiar
with
the
cycle
itself
and
this
integrated
view
of
the
process
inaction
will
itself
be
a
valuable
tool
we
have
heard
from
instructors
who
have
tried
this
type
of
approach
that
the
last
two
steps
merge
together
and
in
the
worst
cases
result
in
deadend
statements
from
students
such
as
i
like
it
one
of
the
challenges
of
adopting
this
approach
is
to
maintain
a
distinct
separation
between
the
analysis
of
a
presentation
be
it
a
speech
or
a
resume
and
the
ultimate
evaluation
of
its
worth
within
a
given
context
for
example
a
group
analysis
of
a
specific
logo
may
reveal
that
half
the
class
deems
it
childish
while
the
other
half
sees
it
as
whimsical
arriving
at
that
conclusion
would
be
achieved
during
the
interpretation
phase
of
the
cycle
however
when
we
move
onto
critique
and
we
look
at
the
company
for
which
the
logo
was
created
say
a
company
that
makes
computer
game
consoles
designed
for
adult
users
we
can
then
start
to
make
value
judgments
that
is
when
we
may
conclude
that
a
whimsical
logo
may
be
better
suited
than
a
childish
one
for
specific
reasons
related
to
the
target
audience
profile
that
was
part
of
the
initial
company
profile
and
a
discussion
of
how
to
optimize
the
graphic
could
follow
it
is
also
important
to
stress
that
this
approach
does
not
need
to
assume
that
students
are
or
will
be
graphic
designers
while
students
mechanical
skills
with
software
and
visual
design
abilities
may
be
limited
the
stress
here
is
on
process
and
problem
solving
many
of
these
students
will
at
some
point
in
their
professional
careers
be
interacting
with
experts
in
marketing
and
design
one
of
our
goals
is
to
provide
them
with
the
vocabulary
and
communication
skills
necessary
to
successfully
collaborate
with
these
other
professionals
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
the
expertise
around
them
additionally
and
just
as
importantly
by
providing
information
students
with
insight
into
a
creative
process
we
will
potentially
enable
them
to
participate
more
fully
in
these
partnerships
making
a
wider
impact
by
bringing
their
knowledge
of
information
technology
into
new
areas
conclusion
in
this
paper
we
have
argued
that
experience
and
interaction
with
the
arts
should
play
an
important
role
in
the
education
of
information
professionals
and
that
this
interaction
will
provide
a
useful
and
necessary
complement
to
the
more
familiar
rational
scientific
model
that
currently
informs
ischool
professional
education
we
discussed
the
principles
inherent
in
an
artsbased
approach
to
learning
in
ischools
we
showed
how
the
work
done
by
information
professionals
is
similar
to
the
work
done
by
creative
and
performing
artists
and
those
in
the
design
professions
finally
we
offered
an
example
of
how
an
ischool
course
is
being
redesigned
using
these
ideas
we
hope
this
brief
account
serves
as
a
stimulus
for
others
to
consider
debate
and
modify
these
ideas
if
an
artsbased
approach
to
technical
and
professional
education
is
to
bear
fruit
much
research
and
development
must
be
done
in
future
work
we
will
propose
research
and
practical
agendas
to
carry
these
ideas
forward
the
arts
are
moving
in
new
directions
and
information
professions
are
moving
into
unknown
territory
as
well
as
the
experimental
arts
evolve
to
include
digital
media
computer
animation
computer
music
sound
art
and
many
novel
combinations
so
also
are
the
information
professions
evolving
to
include
unexpected
collaborations
with
colleagues
from
other
fields
and
opportunities
to
make
contributions
across
many
social
and
organizational
contexts
we
believe
that
the
educational
approach
we
have
outlined
will
prepare
our
students
to
meet
these
challenges
