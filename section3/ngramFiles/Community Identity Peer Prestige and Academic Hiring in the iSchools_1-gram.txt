abstract
exploring
indicators
of

as
they
relate
to
measures
of
prestige
presented
in
peer

provides
a
new
perspective
on
hiring
and
identity
in
the
ischools
this
study
examines
a
hiring
network
for
the
ischool
community
and
finds
that
the
perception
of
prestige
among
ischools
as
represented
by
the
us
news
world

usnwr
graduate
school
ratings
may
be
improved
by
hiring
choices
that
strengthen
connections
within
the
ischool
community
balanced
by
increasing
the
diversity
of
sources
for
new
faculty
we
compare
the
academic

the

the

the

introduction
prestige
ratings
are
a
commonly
consulted
indicator
of
image
and
identity
for
a
community
in
which
identity
is
a
matter
of
concern
inclusive
prestige
scores
can
position
each
school
in
a
community
context
prestige
ratings
based
on
peer
survey
responses
published
by
such
groups
as
usnwr
and
the
national
research
council
nrc
imply
a
hierarchy
of
quality
and
prestige
in
the
institutions
reviewed
one
target
audience
for
the
ratings
is
collegebound
students
and
as
such
the
ratings
project
an
important
aspect
of
identity
with
respect
to
student
recruitment
this
gives
us
reason
to
question
the
value
of
the
survey
responses
as
indicators
of
academic
program
quality
for
the
interdisciplinary
ischools
particularly
because
existing
ratings
such
as
the
prevalent
prestige
ratings
for

for

conference
we
begin
with
a
brief
review
of
the
literature
related
to
identity
prestige
and
hiring
in
academia
we
then
discuss
the
methods
we
used
to
examine
the
relationship
between
prestige
as
a
proxy
for
identity
within
a
community
and
the
exchange
of
social
capital
represented
by
academic
hiring
we
provide
a
descriptive
comparison
of
the
hiring
networks
for
topranked
computer
science
cs
departments
and
the
ischools
and
present
the
results
of
regression
analysis
on
prestige
ratings
for
each
network
we
also
examine
additional
aspects
of
the
ischool
community
based
on
the
composition
of
faculty
specifically
the
phenomenon
of
selfhiring
and
the
diversity
of
disciplines
represented
by
the
faculty
of
the
ischools
literature
review
growing
interest
in
the
formation
of
community
identity
in
ischools
inspired
conference
papers
on
this
theme
at
the
iconference
some
concerns
included
student
recruitment
and
student
placement
which
are
particularly
challenging
for
a
new
academic
discipline
and
are
critical
to
the
ongoing
success
of
the
ischools
identity
is
a
clear
root
factor
in
these
challenges
as
a
lack
of
awareness
of
the
ischool
movement
hinders
student
recruitment
efforts
and
program
graduates
must
be
able
to
clearly
articulate
the
identity
and
value
of
their
interdisciplinary
studies
to
secure
employment
further
challenges
identified
at
the
iconference
pertain
to
the
development
of
the
scholarly
community
from
the
perspectives
of
publication
funding
and
interdisciplinary
research
efforts
in
other
recently
established
disciplines
such
as
africanamerican
studies
and
professional
fields
such
as
mis
concerns
over
organizational
and
disciplinary
legitimacy
play
a
strong
role
in
the
development
of
disciplinary
identity
in
academia
departmental
prestige
is
often
considered
a
reflection
of
identity
a
variety
of
studies
of
academic
prestige
in
the
social
sciences
have
shown
that
departmental
prestige
is
related
to
faculty
hiring
practices
when
hiring
is
based
on
criteria
such
as
prestige
instead
of
more
meritbased
criteria
such
as
scholarly
productivity
researcher
are
concerned
about
potentially
detrimental
effects
to
the
field
in
the
form
of
academic
inbreeding
and
greater
stratification
of
prestige
these
prior
studies
of
academic
hiring
have
repeatedly
shown
phd
program
prestige
to
be
much
more
relevant
to
postphd
job
placement
prestige
than
scholarly
productivity
at
the
time
of
graduation
and
while
scholarly
productivity
has
little
influence
on
hiring
hiring
has
a
strong
effect
on
scholarly
productivity
evaluating
faculty
productivity
for
the
ischools
proves
difficult
due
to
the
interdisciplinarity
of
the
community
particularly
for
comparison
to
prestige
as
there
are
currently
no
ratings
that
are
inclusive
of
the
entire
community
although
lis
research
faculty
productivity
has
previously
been
measured
through
publication
and
citation
rates
increasing
departmental
interdisciplinarity
and
incompleteness
of
databases
poses
significant
challenges
to
the
validity
of
lis
faculty
productivity
studies
in
addition
evaluating
lis
schools
alone
would
exclude
several
ischools
that
are
not
accredited
by
the
ala
and
evaluating
the
ischools
based
only
on
their
lis
programs
would
not
appropriately
represent
the
breadth
of
the
relevant
faculty
expertise
accounting
for
the
variations
across
ischools
that
is
introduced
by
their
interdisciplinarity
will
remain
a
challenge
in
any
attempt
to
rank
these
schools
based
on
scholarly
productivity
methods
this
study
evaluates
whether
network
measures
of
centrality
can
predict
the
peer
survey
prestige
ratings
that
are
a
part
of
the
community
context
of
identity
in
an
academic
discipline
a
network
data
set
representing
faculty
hiring
in
the
ischools
was
generated
through
manual
data
collection
while
this
data
would
traditionally
be
collected
through
a
survey
of
faculty
or
from
a
directory
that
aggregates
faculty
survey
data
by
department
or
academic
field
either
of
these
methods
would
be
subject
to
an
unacceptable
level
of
bias
due
to
inaccuracies
and
omissions
for
this
reason
the
sampling
frame
was
compiled
from
faculty
rosters
on
institutional
web

which
are
updated
more
frequently
than
published

and
are
considered
the
most

constructing
hiring
networks
to
examine
the
relationship
between
hiring
and
peer
prestige
we
constructed
an
ischool
hiring
network
of
institutional
affiliations
by
combining
ego
networks
for
each
ischool
institution
ego
networks
are
constructed
based
on
the
set
of
connections
for
a
focal
node
called
an
ego
each
node
directly
connected
to
the
ego
is
known
as
its
alter
connections
between
the
schools
are
based
on
the
institutions
from
which
current
ischool
faculty
received
their
phd
degrees
using
the
university
as
the
unit
of
analysis
each
connection
between
the
schools
is
a
weighted
directed
link
these
links
are
directed
from
the
graduating
institution
to
the
employing
institution
for
each
faculty
person
the
weights
for
the
links
represent
the
number
of
academics
who
share
these
graduation
and
employment
affiliations
constructing
the
network
unfortunately
required
merging
the
two
ischools
at
indiana
university
in
order
to
maintain
the
institution
as
the
unit
of
analysis
since
both
the
ischool
and
cs
networks
are
constructed
in
the
same
way
by
merging
ego
networks
they
are
composed
of
a
set
of
inside
nodes
for
which
we
have
incoming
links
information
on
which
other
departments
they
hired
from
and
the
remainder
of
the
nodes
for
which
there
are
no
inbound
edges
those
outside
nodes
have
only
outbound
edges
and
are
included
in
the
dataset
if
a
graduate
of
the
department
was
hired
by
one
of
the
departments
sampled
in
the
ischool
network
the
inside
nodes
or
egos
are
the
ischools
and
the
outside
nodes
or
alters
are
other
institutions
that
do
not
have
information
schools
affiliated
with
the
ischool
caucus
in
the
computer
science
network
the
inside
nodes
are
the
most
highly
ranked
departments
this
method
produces
a
network
with
many
leaf
nodes
representing
those
schools
that
did
not
provide
faculty
to
more
than
one
inside
node
and
for
which
we
did
not
gather
information
on
current
faculty
both
the
ischools
and
cs
departments
are
portions
of
the
larger
academic
sphere
from
which
we
draw
relational
information
as
ego
networks
there
is
an
inherent
bias
in
these
data
while
we
have
complete
information
about
the
relationships
between
schools
that
are
egos
in
the
networks
we
have
incomplete
information
about
those
for
which
we
only
know
that
some
of
their
graduates
were
hired
into
the
academic
units
that
were
sampled
to
compare
measures
of
social
and
network
prestige
in
these
networks
hiring
the
graduate
of
an
institution
is
considered
an
endorsement
in
which
patterns
of
association
indicate
social
exchange
measuring
diversity
in
hiring
networks
schools
follow
varying
strategies
to
build
a
strong
faculty
some
are
highly
specialized
while
others
are
highly
interdisciplinary
two
information
entropy
calculations
provide
measures
of
diversity
in
hiring
sources
and
in
areas
of
subject
specialization
by
applying
the
calculation
from
shannon
flogf
where
f
is
the
percentage
of
the
faculty
in
a
given
category
either
based
on
their
area
of
expertise
or
the
institution
from
which
they
received
their
degrees
when
applied
to
the
hiring
data
for
each
school
the
hiring
diversity
measure
reflects
both
the
variety
and
strength
of
connections
to
other
schools
schools
that
hire
preferentially
from
a
small
handful
of
highlyrespected
sources
will
have
low
hiring
diversity
scores
and
schools
that
hire
from
a
wide
variety
of
institutions
without
strong
favorites
will
have
high
diversity
scores
the
hiring
diversity
measure
was
generated
for
both
networks
in
addition
to
hiring
diversity
an
information
entropy
measure
for
disciplinary
diversity
was
calculated
for
the
ischools
the
same
information
entropy
formula
was
applied
to
the
percentage
of
faculty
with
degrees
in
each
subject
family
the
resulting
disciplinary
diversity
scores
are
highest
for
the
most
interdisciplinary
schools
and
lowest
for
schools
with
a
very
strong
disciplinary
focus
as
reflected
in
the
subject
areas
studied
by
their
faculty
analysis
and
discussion
the
analysis
and
discussion
of
the
data
are
presented
in
several
parts
first
we
compare
the
structures
of
the
ischool
and
cs
hiring
networks
which
are
similar
with
regard
to
their
connectedness
but
demonstrate
different
hiring
tendencies
in
each
community
next
we
examine
the
relationship
between
peer
prestige
and
hiring
network
statistics
in
both
ischools
and
cs
departments
using
regression
analysis
we
also
discuss
the
phenomenon
of
selfhiring
in
ischools
and
finally
we
discuss
the
faculty
areas
of
study
and
the
related
topic
of
disciplinary
diversity
in
the
ischools
comparing
the
ischool
and
cs
networks
several
global
network
properties
contribute
to
understanding
the
context
of
the
interactions
that
each
hiring
network
represents
the
size
of
the
network
can
be
evaluated
in
several
ways
the
most
apparent
measures
are
the
number
of
nodes
and
edges
and
the
ratio
of
edges
to
nodes
which
gives
the
average
degree
of
the
nodes
in
the
network
the
networks
statistics
shown
in
table
reveal
that
the
ischools
network
has
a
lower
density
lower
average
degree
lower
clustering
coefficient
and
lower
average
edge
weight
than
the
cs
network
the
number
of
degrees
summarized
in
each
network
is
the
primary
reason
for
this
difference
while
the
number
of
egos
in
each
network
plays
a
significant
role
in
determining
these
statistics
one
notable
difference
between
the
two
networks
is
seen
in
the
ratio
of
alters
to
egos
the
ischools
have
more
than
twice
as
many
alters
for
every
ego
as
do
the
cs
departments
indicating
that
the
ischools
hire
from
a
greater
diversity
of
sources
than
the
cs
departments

both
the

contribute
to

for

networks
the
cs
network
represents
doctoral
degrees
with
more
egos
and
fewer
nodes
than
the
ischool
network
which
represents
faculty
phds
the
number
of
edges
into
which
these
degrees
are
summarized
provides
another
point
for
comparison
shown
in
table
as
the
average
edge
weight
for
the
network
which
indicates
how
strongly
the
schools
in
the
network
are
linked
the
difference
in
average
edge
weights
between
the
networks
may
represent
a
number
of
factors
such
as
the
longer
tenure
of
the
cs
departments
which
has
allowed
them
to
build
stronger
ties
within
their
community
over
time
these
statistics
show
that
the
ischool
network
is
more
loosely
coupled
than
the
cs
network
and
continues
to
demonstrate
the
difference
in
hiring
diversity
between
the
networks
on
average
the
ischools
hire
from
more
than
twice
as
many
alters
as
the
cs
departments
we
also
find
that
both
networks
exhibit
a
low
diameter
and
high
clustering
coefficient
shown
in
comparison
to
the
statistics
for
comparable
random
erdsrnyi
graphs
in
table
which
are
key
characteristics
of
small
world
networks
despite
other
structural
differences
the
two
networks
are
remarkably
alike
in
these
small
world
characteristics
with
very
similar
average
distances
diameters
and
average
clustering
coefficients
combined
with
the
comparable
betweenness
centralizations
this
suggests
that
the
ischools
network
is
structurally
similar
to
the
cs
network
in
terms
of
graph
connectedness
even
though
other
aspects
of
the
network
structures
indicate
different
strategies
for
hiring
prestige
and
usnwr
ratings
regression
on
network
prestige
and
centrality
measures
was
applied
to
explain
the
variance
in
usnwr
ratings
rantings
such
as
those
presented
by
usnwr
and
the
nrc
are
considered
important
as
indicators
of
institutional
identity
within
the
larger
academic
community
context
if
hiring
represents
a
contributing
factor
the
schools
identity
then
the
centrality
measures
for
the
hiring
network
may
explain
some
of
the
differences
in
peer
prestige
perceptions
as
reported
in
the
surveys
that
make
up
usnwr
ratings
in
this
analysis

the
usnwr

for
the

were
collected
for
the
egos
of
the
network
peer
prestige

the
usnwr
and
nrc
ratings
are
based
on
peer
review
both
originate
from
surveys
sent
to
members
of
the
academic
community
every
few
years
in
which
respondents
provide
ratings
of
perceived
quality
for
the
programs
in
their
discipline
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
these
data
may
be
confounded
by
the
respondents
preferences
for
their
own
alma
maters
with
the
potential
effect
of
inflating
the
prestige
ratings
for
schools
with
larger
numbers
of
graduates
simply
by
virtue
of
a
greater
number
of
their
graduates
being
positioned
to
respond
to
the
surveys
the
usnwr
ratings
used
in
this
analysis
were
based
on
a
survey
in
both
cs
and
lis
which
had
respective
response

several
network
measures
were
significant
in
explaining
the
variance
in
usnwr
ratings
and
one
variable
for
each
regression
proved
particularly
interesting
the
negative
coefficient
for
indegree
from
the
cs
regression
means
that
a
higher
indegree
has
a
negative
effect
on
a
schools
rating

the
cs
departments
receive
lower
ratings
if
they

of

while

diversity
was
rejected
as
a
regression
coefficient
for
the
cs
network
it
was
rejected
because
indegree
provided
a
slightly
stronger
result
which
can
be
interpreted
as
evidence
of
prestige
stratification
in
the
network
in

adding
hiring
diversity
to
the
regression
analysis
explained
an
additional
of
the
variance
in
the
ischool
usnwr
ratings
literally
interpreted
this
means
that
hiring
faculty
more
evenly
from
a
broader
range
of
schools
is
a
practice
that
is
rewarded
with
higher
prestige
ratings
in
the
ischool
network
the
regression
results
for
these
two
networks
reiterate
the
descriptive
comparison
of
the
network
characteristics
while
there
are
some
structural
similarities
between
them
the
ischools
and
cs
departments
differ
with
respect
to
the
diversity
of
hiring
sources
accessed
by
the
egos
of
each
network
in
the
context
of
the
academic
communities
of
computer
science
and
information
the
amount
of
variance
explained
by
regression
and
level
of
confidence
are
evidence
that
the
hiring
in
cs
departments
forms
a
social
exchange
structure
that
is
more
cohesive
and
predictable
than
the
ischool
community
at
this
point
in
time
a
much
younger
discipline
such
as
the
emerging
field
of
information
would
not
have
the
same
context
for
describing
itself
through
a
peer
evaluation
as
a
more
established
discipline
such
as
cs
in
the
case
of
the
ischools
these
aggregated
peer
ratings
only
evaluate
a
portion
of
the
community
on
a
subset
of
its
programs
however
the
regression
results
indicate
that
being
well
connected
to
the
community
through
diverse
hiring
practices
improves
the
peer
perception
of
prestige
for
ischools
selfhiring
the
data
also
provide
insight
into
the
practice
of
selfhiring
in
the
ischools
nearly
all
of
the
ischools
hire
faculty
from
their
own
parent
institution
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
for
this
phenomenon
first
the
faculty
may
come
from
other
departments
within
the
institution
and
second
the
ischools
hiring
choices
for
faculty
specializing
in
such
areas
as
archives
and
librarianship
are
more
constrained
due
to
the
relatively
small
number
of
phd
granting
programs
in
these
disciplines
in
the
first
case
where
faculty
are
hired
from
other
departments
within
the
institution
the
ischool
network
departs
significantly
from
the
social
science
departments
in
burris
study
which
hired
from
their
own
graduates
selfhiring
in
ischools
may
in
fact
represent
greater
diversity
in
the
interdisciplinary
nature
of
these
hires
pennsylvania
state
universitys
ischool
was
founded
recently
enough
to
have
none
of
its
own
graduates
on
faculty
as
is
also
the
case
for
the
university
of
washington
at
psu
however
nearly
of
faculty
received
their
degree
from
psu
where
hiring
from
other
departments
in
the
university
may
support
interdisciplinary
diversity
within
the
faculty
of
the
ischool
in
contrast
washingtons
faculty
is
comprised
entirely
of
graduates
of
other
institutions
with
no
selfhires
whatsoever
making
their
ischool
the
single
exception
in
the
community
in
this
regard
the
ischools
on
average
hired
of
their
faculty
from
their
own
institutions
for
the
ischools
that
had
hired
faculty
with
a
degree
from
their
parent
institution
approximately
of
the
selfhires
were
graduates
of
the
program
that
now
employs
them
about
of
the
total
population
in
most
cases
these
are
faculty
with
degrees
in
library
science
supporting
the
idea
that
faculty
specialization
in
this
area
is
subject
to
greater
hiring
constraint
ucla
is
an
exception
in
that
most
of
its
selfhires
were
graduates
of
its
education
program
rather
than
library
science
selfhiring
is
not
necessarily
a
case
of
a
schools
graduates
immediately
joining
the
faculty
of
the
school
granting
their
degrees
although
such
a
scenario
has
occurred
it
is
more
likely
that
a
significant
proportion
of
these
individuals
had
their
first
tenuretrack
employment
in
academia
with
another
institution
and
returned
to
their
alma
mater
years
later
faculty
areas
of
study
the
graduating
department
or
program
of
study
for
the
faculty
of
ischools
was
a
point
of
interest
for
two
reasons
first
in
the
event
of
selfloops
where
a
university
has
hired
its
own
graduates
we
were
interested
to
know
whether
these
individuals
were
hired
by
the
same
department
from
which
they
had
graduated
or
from
a
different
school
within
the
university
a
second
reason
to
examine
faculty
areas
of
study
is
that
identity
characteristics
for
each
ischool
such
as
programs
of
study
and
courses
are
both
influenced
by
the
areas
of
expertise
represented
on
its
faculty
and
influential
to
hiring
choices
classifying
faculty
degrees
the
population
of
ischool
faculty
included
phd
degrees
in
distinct
programs
of
study
these
programs
were
coded
according
to
the
classification
of
instructional
programs
cip
and
further
summarized
to
form
broad
disciplinary
categories
shown
in
figure
there
was
some
ambiguity
regarding
how
to
classify
programs
entitled
library
and
information
science
or
information
and
library
science
these
were
all
coded
as
library
science
because
there
was
a
substantial
and
clearly
differentiated
population
of
faculty
with
degrees
in
information
science
the
initial
coding
of
the
faculty
areas
of
study
to
cip
families
yielded
categories
however
some
categories
such
as
family
sciences
included
very
few
individuals
and
other
categories
such
as
engineering
and
engineering
technologies
were
sufficiently
similar
as
to
provide
little
additional
insight
for
analysis
purposes
the
cip
categories
were
compressed
into
the
summary
categories
presented
in
figure
the
majority
of
the
faculty
degrees
in
the
population
were
in
computer
and
information
sciences
making
up
about
of
the
population
the
next
most
common
area
of
study
for
of
the
faculty
was
library
science
some
portion
of
those
degrees
classified
in
the
former
category
might
arguably
have
fit
into
the
latter
if
consistent
detail
about
the
program
of
study
had
been
available
for
faculty
with
degrees
in
such
areas
as
information
studies
but
data
at
a
level
of
granularity
to
allow
discrimination
between
degree
programs
were
not
universally
available
as
a
community
the
interdisciplinarity
of
the
field
is
selfevident
although
the
ischools
have
varying
levels
of
focus
on
specific
aspects
of
the
information
field
which
seems
to
be
a
strategy
by
which
schools
differentiate
themselves
with
respect
to
the
community
while
permitting
the
analysis
coding
the
faculty
degree
programs
and
departments
into
cip
families
obscures
the
true
diversity
of
the
academic
studies
in
ischools
especially
within
the
category
of
computer
and
information
sciences
the
breadth
of
the
academic
traditions
represented
in
the
schools
currently
granting
degrees
in
information
science
or
information
studies
means
that
the
expertise
of
faculty
with
degrees
in
these
areas
may
be
very
diverse
as
well
disciplinary
diversity
in
ischools
wile
most
of
the
faculty
in
ischools
studied
computer
and
information
sciences
or
library
science
a
full
of
the
faculty
members
studied
in
other
fields
bringing
great
diversity
to
the
ischool
community
we
generated
a
continuous
scale
by
which
to
evaluate
the
interdisciplinary
diversity
of
faculty
expertise
at
ischools
by
using
an
information
entropy
measure
based
on
the
number
of
faculty
with
degrees
from
each
disciplinary
category
this
disciplinary
diversity
measure
clearly
distinguishes
between
hiring
strategies
that
cultivate
interdisciplinary
diversity
and
strategies
that
pursue
a
rich
but
narrow
focus
in
terms
of
the
diversity
of
faculty
expertise
there
is
significant

one
interpretation
would
gauge
the
interdisciplinarity
of
the
schools
by
the
distribution
of
faculty
representing
different
areas
of
study
some
schools
have
chosen
to
pursue
a
rich
but
narrow
focus
such
as
the
university
of
north
carolina
whose
facultys
studies
are
strongly
centered
around
library
science
and
computer
and
information
science
in
contrast
schools
such
as
the
university
of
michigan
have
made
a
specific
goal
of
cultivating
a
broadly
interdisciplinary
faculty
and
have
hired
academics
representing
of
the
aggregated
cip
families
the
disciplinary
diversity
measure
seems
to
support
this
interpretation
michigan
and
syracuse
stand
out
with
the
highest
scores
indicating
the
greatest
interdisciplinarity
while
schools
such
as
unc
and
the
university
of
toronto
cluster
together
with
the
lowest
scores
indicating
the
greatest
focus
in
subject
specialization
the
variations
in
disciplinary
diversity
indicate
different
approaches
to
building
an
organizational
identity
through
hiring
practices
at
each
ischool
as
each
faculty
represents
a
different
composition
of
disciplinary
expertise
naturally
a
small
faculty
will
tend
to
represent
fewer
disciplines
but
as
table
suggests
size
and
disciplinary
diversity
are
not
strongly
correlated
r
in
the
ischools
a
fulltime
faculty
of
or
fewer
persons
will
most
likely
have
faculty
expertise
in
five
or
fewer
broad
disciplines
one
notable
exception
is
the
university
of
maryland
where
a
small
faculty
of
seventeen
individuals
spanned
eleven
disciplines
above
the
threshold
of
fulltime
faculty
members
the
ischools
usually
employ
academics
with
expertise
in
eight
or
more
academic
areas
of
study
conclusions
finding
that
peer
prestige
measures
such
as
usnwr
ratings
can
be
predicted
with
hiring
network
statistics
is
reason
to
question
what
these
ratings
really
mean
to
a
schools
identity
peer
ratings
can
play
an
important
part
in
perceptions
of
a
schools
prestige
and
role
in
the
academic
community
as
these
ratings
are
targeted
to
prospective
students
managing
the
prestige
aspects
of
image
and
identity
may
be
a
matter
of
particular
interest
to
ischool
administrators
the
ischool
community
itself
has
expressed
concern
over
explaining
the
academic
identity
of
the
information
field
a
challenge
that
extends
to
the
degree
to
which
peer
prestige
ratings
do
or
do
not
reflect
the
true
community
identity
because
the
peer
prestige
ratings
are
currently
subject
to
accreditationbased
populations
for
sampling
an
interdisciplinary
community
will
continue
to
face
challenges
in
achieving
a
useful
summary
representation
of
the
relative
identities
of
its
constituents
we
intend
to
track
the
changes
to
ischool
faculty
rosters
on
an
annual
basis
generating
a
series
of
data
sets
that
reflect
snapshots
in
the
evolution
of
the
hiring
network
structure
this
research
will
monitor
whether
the
interdisciplinary
field
of
information
is
following
the
trend
of
most
academic
disciplines
in
which
a
stratified
prestige
structure
becomes
one
of
the
strongest
determinants
in
the
placement
of
graduates
comparison
to
the
cs
hiring
network
shows
some
meaningful
differences
from
this
trend
suggesting
that
the
interdisciplinarity
of
the
ischool
community
could
prevent
the
level
of
prestigebased
academic
inbreeding
observed
in
other
disciplines
there
are
a
number
of
additional
possibilities
for
future
research
such
as
generating
a
hiring
network
of
all
alaaccredited
institutions
for
comparison
to
the
ischools
which
might
highlight
interesting
differences
between
the
hiring
structures
of
traditional
lis
programs
and
the
interdisciplinary
ischools
in
addition
the
data
from
and
results
of
this
study
could
be
compared
to
a
complementary
network
representing
ischool
phd
graduate
placement
finally
analysis
merging
ischool
hiring
and
phd
graduate
placement
data
sets
would
offer
a
more
holistic
view
of
the
interactions
of
intellectual
exchange
in
the
community
as
an
artifact
of
the
information
school
movement
this
study
holds
a
mirror
up
to
the
ischool
community
but
it
must
be
clear
that
there
is
no
fairest
of
them
all
as
suggested
by
prestige
ratings
the
multiplicity
of
criteria
that
are
relevant
to
the
true
measures
of
success
in
an
institution
may
be
commonly
held
among
many
of
the
schools
in
the
community
but
the
valuation
of
those
factors
is
unique
to
each
institutional
context
