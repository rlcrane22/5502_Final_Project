look at event reactions
at event reactions that
event reactions that require

reactions to an event

continuing with our example
with our example imagine
our example imagine that
there is a customer

representative who sees all
who sees all the
sees all the new
all the new warning
the new warning value
new warning value changes
warning value changes and

prompted to call the
to call the cardholder
call the cardholder to
the cardholder to inquire
cardholder to inquire about

inquire about the status
about the status of

this approach to eda
approach to eda is
dependent on the human
on the human reaction
the human reaction to

that may be good
may be good or
be good or bad

for example many intrusion

many intrusion detection systems
intrusion detection systems that
detection systems that monitor
systems that monitor networks
that monitor networks for
unauthorized access attempts generate

generate a great deal
a great deal of

as the person who
the person who monitors

there are some intrusion
are some intrusion detections
some intrusion detections that
intrusion detections that are

that are not monitored
are not monitored at
not monitored at all
implemented systems do is
systems do is generate
do is generate logs
is generate logs consisting
generate logs consisting of

consisting of thousands of
of thousands of possible
thousands of possible intrusion
of possible intrusion records
which are essentially useless
the takeaway here is
takeaway here is that
here is that the
is that the human
that the human reaction
the human reaction is
human reaction is very
reaction is very much
is very much part
very much part of
the eda design even
eda design even though

it does not involve

not involve technology per

finally there are edas
there are edas where

for example an eda
might generate a number
generate a number of
a number of alerts
number of alerts a
of alerts a number
alerts a number of
a number of stock
number of stock market
of stock market indicators
an investor then reviews

decides whether to buy
whether to buy or

once again the eda
