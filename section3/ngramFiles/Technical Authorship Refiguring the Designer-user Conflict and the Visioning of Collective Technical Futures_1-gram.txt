abstract
this
paper
argues
for
the
application
of
authorship
analysis
to
technology
design
it
extends
techniques
used
in
science
studies
to
investigate
scientific
authorship
in
order
to
define
a
concept
of
technical
authorship
to
illustrate
the
potential
of
this
approach
authorship
analysis
is
applied
to
particular
prescriptive
software
design
methodologies
including
participatory
design
and
agile
software
development
the
results
of
this
analysis
are
the
recognition
that
a
design
methodologies
are
rhetorics
of
authorship
b
the
designeruser
relationship
can
be
seen
as
a
conflict
of
contested
authorship
and
c
this
conflict
can
be
seen
within
the
tensions
in
the
figuration
of
the
user
and
the
designer
along
a
subjectobject
continuum
figuration
a
technique
used
by
donna
haraway
brings
about
a
new
understanding
of
the
centrality
of
the
user
in
the
design
process
as
well
as
the
role
of
the
designer
as
the
contested
author
technical
futures
the
implications
suggest
that
design
researchers
might
use
authorship
as
a
new
approach
to
the
politics
of
design
by
refiguring
the
designer
and
user
rather
than
collapsing
the
distinction
between
these
roles

authorship
is

in

in

michel

first
drew
attention
to
the

of
the

of

its
historical

and
the

that
it
serves
in

what
is

he
points
to
the
fact
that
there
is
both
an
empirical
individual
author
and
an
authorfunction
that
requires
the
construction
of
a
figure
of
an
author
who
is
outside
and
precedes
the
authored

the

and
its

arose
as

donna
haraway
and
others
in
science
studies
have
developed
this
approach
further
to
analyze
the
scientific
author
its
origins
and
implications
the
scientific
author
is
the
authoritative
voice
of
objective
reasoning
that
produces
facts
out
of
the
experimental
practices
of
the
sciences
latour
shapin
haraway
and
others
have
helped
to
explain
the
origins
of
how
this
particular
authorial
voice
came
to
be
as
well
as
it
how
it
continues
to
be
taken
for
granted
latour
especially
focuses
on
how
the
everyday
practices
of
the
laboratory
aid
in
the
social
construction
of
facts
thus
unveiling
the
scientific
author
empirical
individual
of
his
garb
of
scientific
objectivity
haraways
focus
shifts
away
from
unmasking
the
scientist
and
towards
the
emergent
authorfigure
who
she
calls
the
modest
witness
borrowing
the
term
from
shapin
and
schaffer
leviathan
and
the
airpump
the
modest
witness
is
the
witness
whose
accounts
mirror
reality
through
selfinvisibility
this
modest
voice
is
that
which
pays
off
its
practitioners
in
the
coin
of
epistemological
and
social
power
it
is
the
virtue
that
guarantees
that
the
scientist
is
the
legitimate
and
authorized
ventriloquist
for
the
object
world
adding
nothing
from
his
mere
opinions
this
scientific
authorial
voice
which
extends
to
much
of
academic
writing
in
the
social
sciences
and
technical
fields
as
well
is
one
that
puts
the
objects
of
study
in
supposedly
plain
view
while
the
author
as
a
subject
disappears
from
the
text
the
modest
witness
is
used
by
the
scientific
author
the
empirical
individual
to
offset
his
role
as
a
subject
authorship
in
the
sciences
appears
subjectless
it
is
a
world
of
objects
that
speak
for
themselves
this
lack
of
a
subject
we
now
take
for
granted
as
that
which
lends
authority
to
the
scientific
text
but
this
authority
had
to
be
shaped
through
the
creation
of
the
figure
of
the
modest
witness
who
steps
aside
and
out
of
view
in
this
paper
we
will
extend
analysis
of
authorship
to
the
field
of
technology
design
relying
primarily
on
the
techniques
used
by
donna
haraway
in
her
book
modestwitnesssecondmillenium
femalemanmeetsoncomouse
one
of
haraways
techniques
is
figuration
which
she
uses
to
draw
up
this
character
of
the
modest
witness
haraways
concept
of
the
figure
is
one
who
collects
up
the
people
a
figure
embodies
shared
meanings
in
stories
that
inhabit
their
audiences
figuration
is
difficult
to
explain
but
we
are
familiar
with
figures
in
particular
the
idea
of
the
christfigure
where
certain
emblematic
features
of
a
character
come
together
through
the
many
metaphoric
uses
of
it
in
different
contexts
or
stories
the
figure
in
technology
design
that
readily
emerges
through
authorship
analysis
is
that
of
the
user
the
user
is
central
to
technology
computational
systems
and
product
design
in
sociological
studies
of
technology
design
however
the
word
has
been
taken
up
as
highly
problematic
it
is
flagged
in
various
debates
within
technology
design
as
in
the
words
userfriendly
usercentered
and
user
experience
aka
ux
it
is
critiqued
ironically
for
its
lack
of
utility
since
it
provides
no
context
characteristics
or
sense
of
expertise
in
fact
ux
responds
to
the
last
challenge
by
establishing
experience
as
the
users
area
of
expertise
user
limits
agency
on
the
receiving
end
of
technology
to
a
single
action
use
and
so
has
been
reconceived
as
actor
knowledgemaker
or
participant
user
can
provide
only
a
generic
sense
of
what
is
userfriendly
or
usable
the
design
researchers
response
to
that
might
be
to
use
methods
of
contextual
inquiry
or
situated
actions
grudin
has
pointed
out
that
the
word
enduser
is
a
retronym
that
tells
us
more
about
the
history
of
the
manmachine
relationship
than
about
the
real
empirical
user
yet
there
is
an
apparent
difficulty
in
dispensing
with
the
word
entirely
authorship
is
a
lens
that
can
help
to
explain
this
persistence
of
the
userfigure
as
problematic
rather
than
trying
to
explain
the
particular
problems
it
causes
haraways
techniques
for
authorship
analysis
using
figuration
suggest
that
what
is
most
interesting
about
the
user
is
the
way
it
is
figured
through
technology
design
the
other
figure
that
emerges
from
authorship
analysis
of
technology
design
is
that
of
the
designer
it
is
not
strange
that
we
as
designers
and
design
researchers
understand
this
figure
far
less
than
we
do
the
userfigure
unlike
the
modest
witness
the
designerfigure
is
still
very
much
in
flux
much
as
the
scientific
authorfigure
was
in
the
th
century
the
many
competing
design
methodologies
point
to
an
unclear
authorfigure
and
even
an
ambivalence
towards
the
designer
as
author
in
fact
authorship
analysis
suggests
that
the
politics
of
technology
design
exist
in
a
conflict
between
the
designer
and
the
user
that
is
one
of
contested
authorship
most
often
is
the
designers
themselves
that
contest
their
own
role
as
author
and
initiate
methods
to
involve
the
users
as
authors
in
the
design
process
but
there
are
also
cases
where
software
developers
or
engineers
with
to
empower
themselves
as
authors
of
the
code
in
cases
where
they
feel
they
have
become
instrumentalized
by
a
design
methodology
motivations
there
are
a
number
of
motivations
for
applying
authorship
analysis
to
technology
design
first
there
are
many
narrative
techniques
used
in
various
design
methodologies
such
as
the
use
of
personas
scenarios
user
stories
and
storyboarding
in
software
systems
development
these
methods
have
been
shown
to
have
communicative
power
in
the
exchange
between
designers
of
technology
and
their
client
or
user
group
but
these
remain
isolated
methods
that
have
not
been
theorized
about
as
a
whole
second
in
technology
design
it
is
openly
acknowledged
that
approaches
to
design
can
be
metaphoric
software
development
is
likened
to
engineering
or
architecture
and
design
methodologies
such
as
waterfall
agile
and
spiral
each
make
use
of
a
metaphor
whether
rigorously
or
no
metaphors
both
reveal
and
conceal
and
are
limited
in
that
they
cannot
provide
an
exhaustive
framework
for
the
evaluation
or
validation
of
best
practices
of
design
still
as
young
disciplines
technology
design
and
design
studies
can
benefit
from
a
greater
diversity
of
metaphors
rather
than
encouraging
a
winnertakesall
atmosphere
among
competing
methodologies
we
should
take
the
time
to
investigate
many
metaphors
for
design
especially
since
the
field
is
still
a
contested
domain
with
allegiances
that
cross
disciplinary
boundaries
of
art
science
and
social
science
as
am
emergent
field
seeking
growth
and
foundational
knowledge
we
must
be
wary
of
eschewing
practices
that
do
not
fit
existing
paradigms
authorship
as
a
lens
for
analysis
not
only
reveals
new
information
about
older
design
practices
but
also
defines
a
new
space
for
understanding
emerging
practices
that
have
thus
far
been
set
aside
by
academia
as
counterproductive
third
technical
authorship
is
a
metaphor
that
opens
the
door
to
collaborative
authoring
that
is
the
creation
of
coauthored
technical
futures
with
many
technology
design
studies
scholars
interested
in
the
politics
of
design
authorship
can
shed
new
light
on
the
power
struggles
within
design
and
suggest
new
paths
to
empowerment
additionally
haraways
method
of
figuration
causes
a
different
sort
of
reflection
on
design
practice
than
other
approaches
to
the
politics
of
design
figuration
allows
us
to
think
about
how
we
might
want
to
shape
or
refigure
the
role
of
the
user
and
designer
instead
of
resisting
this
dichotomy
haraway
suggests
a
method
of
diffraction
for
refiguration
which
we
will
not
go
into
in
this
paper
and
finally
there
are
many
parallels
between
science
studies
and
technology
studies
that
are
only
beginning
to
be
explored
in
this
paper
we
will
be
drawing
some
parallels
that
at
times
are
a
bit
shaky
between
technical
authorship
and
scientific
authorship
with
the
hope
that
future
work
that
takes
up
this
approach
might
lead
us
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
science
and
technology
technical
authorship
the
concept
of
authorship
in
the
sciences
which
was
introduced
above
is
that
of
an
author
who
presents
facts
about
the
natural
world
he
investigates
but
authorship
of
technology
seems
to
differ
from
scientific
authorship
in
that
it
is
less
a
particular
voice
found
in
the
texts
designers
produce
than
the
very
material
shape
of
their
technologies
in
science
studies
however
much
attention
has
been
drawn
to
the
way
that
texts
of
all
kinds
from
reports
to
talks
to
notebook
scribbles
and
the
scientific
instruments
play
a
role
in
authoring
science
in
design
it
is
often
use
itself
that
is
authored
where
the
technological
product
the
design
methodology
and
even
the
users
themselves
provide
the
assemblage
that
shapes
use
so
the
material
nature
of
authoring
technology
is
not
a
major
issue
however
in
order
to
extend
authorship
analysis
to
technology
design
the
idea
of
technical
authorship
still
needs
to
be
introduced
in
order
to
clarify
how
authorship
applies
to
design
of
technology
technical
authorship
is
a
way
to
look
at
technology
not
as
only
an
artifact
that
is
constructed
but
also
as
a
vision
of
the
future
that
is
authored
it
is
a
technical
future
that
is
authored
through
the
practices
of
the
designer
which
can
include
any
number
of
activities
such
as
requirements
engineering
prototyping
iterative
development
and
especially
through
its
successful
implementation
and
use
authorship
is
just
one
lens
or
metaphor
through
which
to
examine
these
design
practices
but
it
is
one
that
is
relatively
unexplored
despite
the
presence
of
narrative
techniques
in
various
design
methodologies
this
paper
will
apply
analysis
of
authorship
to
some
design
methodologies
in
order
to
reveal
just
a
sampling
of
the
potential
outcomes
that
this
approach
can
bring
in
particular
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
papers
authors
that
certain
practices
in
design
that
are
often
considered
atheoretical
or
amethodological
may
be
better
elucidated
through
this
alternate
metaphor
of
technical
authorship
authorship
analysis
of
technology
design
a
note
on
scope
it
would
be
impossible
to
exhaust
the
potential
for
analyzing
authorship
in
technology
design
in
a
single
paper
instead
we
will
provide
a
single
attempt
to
look
at
software
design
methodologies
through
authorship
analysis
as
a
way
to
demonstrate
the
powers
of
this
approach
in
our
research
labs
ongoing
research
we
contend
that
design
methodologies
exist
in
two
forms
prescriptive
and
empirical
and
it
is
infrequent
that
a
prescriptive
method
is
followed
precisely
or
that
empirical
design
is
ever
amethodical
even
when
it
does
not
follow
a
prescribed
method
in
this
paper
we
will
attempt
to
investigate
the
rhetorics
of
authorship
located
in
prescriptive
design
methodologies
but
we
also
want
to
point
out
that
there
would
be
equal
if
not
greater
value
in
applying
authorship
analysis
to
investigate
empirical
design
practices
where
a
specific
technical
future
useproduct
is
authored
by
approaching
design
methodologies
as
rhetorical
devices
we
will
also
touch
upon
the
authorial
voice
of
those
design
researchers
who
are
writing
the
design
methodologies
you
will
notice
in
the
quotations
provided
that
it
wanders
a
great
deal
at
times
it
is
the
scientific
author
modest
presenting
design
as
a
scientific
object
of
study
at
other
times
it
is
a
voice
that
resembles
inspirational
or
selfhelp
writing
leading
the
readerdesigner
through
personal
development
to
better
design
practice
design
methodologies
as
rhetorics
of
authorship
the
first
thing
that
becomes
clear
in
looking
at
prescriptive
design
methodology
literature
is
that
nearly
all
design
methodologies
must
address
the
relationship
between
a
user
and
a
designer
though
there
is
some
design
literature
which
treats
design
much
more
as
an
artistic
and
craft
approach
and
disregards
the
user
and
use
entirely
however
while
there
are
many
design
approaches
that
explicitly
address
the
divide
between
the
designer
and
the
user
these
do
not
view
the
conflict
as
one
of
contested
authorship
rather
the
divide
between
the
designers
vision
and
the
users
experience
is
most
frequently
addressed
because
of
the
urgent
and
abrupt
way
that
the
latter
can
rupture
the
former
massive
failures
of
systems
are
often
cited
as
evidence
that
design
should
involve
the
user
through
the
lens
of
authorship
it
becomes
clear
that
both
technical
expert
designer
and
nontechnical
nonexpert
the
user
are
envisioning
the
technology
in
different
ways
the
design
process
then
appears
as
a
negotiation
or
conflict
over
authorship
which
in
many
cases
does
not
truly
resolve
many
approaches
to
technical
systems
design
seek
to
involve
the
user
explicitly
in
the
design
process
methods
such
as
participatory
design
seeks
a
political
aim
to
deinstrumentalize
the
user
who
can
often
be
the
subject
of
power
alliances
between
designers
and
clients
participatory
design
has
revealed
design
as
embedded
within
a
politics
of
the
workplace
because
of
this
it
has
focused
primarily
on
the
conflict
between
management
and
the
worker
and
on
combating
the
ways
that
technology
can
instrumentalize
the
user
usercentered
design
on
the
other
hand
has
focused
on
the
conflict
as
a
research
problem
and
involves
the
user
for
a
clearer
understanding
of
user
and
task
requirements
this
approach
may
produce
technology
that
does
not
instrumentalize
the
user
in
a
heideggerian
sense
but
does
forge
the
user
into
the
designers
instrument
for
understanding
use
in
agile
software
development
and
extreme
programming
the
tension
shifts
in
the
other
direction
the
technical
engineer
is
seen
to
have
been
disempowered
in
the
workplace
unable
to
take
pride
in
the
craft
of
software
design
and
instrumentalized
as
the
tool
through
which
software
is
enacted
the
agile
manifesto
and
books
like
extreme
programming
explained
embrace
change
by
kent
beck
introduce
a
message
to
empower
the
programmer
or
software
engineer
through
a
kind
of
bottomup
subversive
selfmanagement
technique
through
the

both
participatory
design
and
agile
methods
can
be
seen
as
attempts
at
coauthorship
though
this
analysis
will
shift
the
metaphor
away
from
that
of
democratic
participation
or
involvement
used
by

researchers
the
impact
of
this
shift
will
be
a
focus
on
the
tension
between
author

this
turns
out
to
be
extremely
useful
in
understanding
emerging

that
have
so
far
been
undertheorized
the
current

in

a

conducted

the
results
of
this

are
summarized
here
by
illustrating
how
figuration
can
fall
along
a
continuum

we
see

at

of

as

along
a
continuum

figure
the

can
never
be
fully
realized
as

at

contextual
inquiry
warns
that
this
is
not
entirely
possible
and
focuses
on
the
agency
of
the
user
in
defining
use
still
even
these
techniques
are
used
to
help
the
designer
witness
and
provide
an
account
of
a
kind
of
objective
use

conscious
of

the

these
tensions
between
subject

and
the
current
state
of
affairs
in
the
rhetorics
of

suggest
that
the
role
of
the

as

is
contingent
on
the
figuration

and
likewise
that
the
role

is
contingent
on
the
figuration

before
we
attempt
to
address
these
tensions
politically
through
projects
to
explore
the
space
where
both
designer
and
user
are
subjects
we
should
first
aim
to
understand
how
these
two
are
figured
in
design
methods
and
practices
figuration
of
the
user
and
designer
we
will
now
turn
to
the
rhetorics
of
authorship
found
in
design
methodology
literature
and
begin
to
shape
the
figure
of
the
user
and
the
designer
that
we
found
through
our
literature
search
when
viewed
as
methodologies
each
approach
may
be
seen
to
align
with
or
critique
another
approach
but
with
the
technique
of
figuration
what
we
look
for
is
the
emergent
figure
of
the
user
not
something
generalized
from
the
literature
the
userfigure
that
emerges
is
unwieldy
difficult
to
communicate
with
and
repellent
in
the
everyday
practice
of
software
engineers
it
is
a
common
sense
notion
that
engineers
do
not
want
to
speak
with
actual
users
that
they
are
incapable
of
communicating
with
users
and
that
users
are
irksome
in
their
language
and
demands
latour
refers
to
the
fierceness
of
disputes
in
the
early
stages
before
a
fact
becomes
a
fact
there
is
a
similar
fierceness
in
the
early
stages
of
design
when
requirements
are
not
fleshed
out
and
this
antagonism
arises
between
the
user
and
the
designer
the
userfigure
is
a
point
of
access
to
a
naturalized
use
designers
who
advocate
for
usercentered
design
or
participatory
design
will
criticize
projects
that
do
not
involve
the
real
user
in
the
design
process
saying
that
the
wants
and
needs
of
real
users
can
never
be
known
without
speaking
directly
to
users
in
largescale
projects
designers
will
often
be
speak
to
users
without
such
political
motivations
as
a
pragmatic
way
to
understand
the
technologys
future
use
in
this
case
a
researcher
will
often
serve
as
a
proxy
to
study
interview
and
observe
users
and
communicate
use
back
to
the
designer
in
this
case
the
userfigure
is
a
way
to
ward
off
false
use
he
is
a
test
for
the
purity
of
use
this
purity
is
set
against
the
impurity
of
the
designer
as
a
solution
to
the
issue
of
communication
the
trouble
with
the
engineer
is
that
he
is
bad
at
talking
to
users
and
there
is
also
the
issue
of
scale
when
the
user
group
and
the
company
hired
to
design
technology
may
both
be
too
large
to
interact
in
a
personal
way
the
designerfigure
must
have
access
to
the
userfigure
because
getting
it
right
matters
particularly
in
large
projects
where
massive
failures
can
arise
there
are
many
invaluable
contributions
of
research
in
this
area
highlighting
context
cognitive
models
and
cultures
of
the
workplace
this
literature
notes
that
technology
must
work
hand
in
hand
not
only
with
use
but
also
with
context
cognition
culture
training
and
management
two
major
disciplinary
outcomes
have
been
the
idea
of
coevolution
and
situated
actions
the
first
concept
tells
us
that
local
contextual
practices
will
shape
how
a
technology
is
adopted
and
technology
will
always
change
those
same
practices
context
cognitive
models
and
cultures
a
priori
will
never
satisfy
these
conditions
there
must
be
some
support
for
a
backandforth
either
of
prototyping
or
studying
use
at
various
stages
situated
actions
highlights
two
aspects
context
and
action
this
refigures
the
user
as
an
actor
who
makes
use
of
technology
in
many
ways
based
on
situations
in
which
he
acts
it
implies
the
autonomy
and
agency
of
the
user
but
only
in
a
rhetorical
way
the
situations
and
the
actions
are
still
seen
as
knowledge
which
can
be
obtained
in
a
modestly
objective
way
through
a
discipline
of
studying
the
context
of
the
technology
in
search
for
situations
and
actions
rather
than
uses
not
only
that
it
subjugates
the
designer
to
the
technology
as
well
by
marking
the
agency
and
autonomy
of
the
designer
as
immodest
it
flips
the
hierarchy
placing
the
actorusers
as
autonomous
and
above
technology
the
technology
itself
should
be
as
objective
as
possible
and
the
designeruser
as
a
modest
witness
to
the
usertechnology
relationship
it
sets
up
an
ideal
vision
of
a
design
process
that
develops
technology
for
a
singleperson
singlesituation
in
which
the
voice
of
the
designer
is
muted
and
the
designer
is
the
instrument
for
obtaining
the
technology
participatory
design
makes
explicit
that
the
user
is
a
usersubject
of
the
technologyemployer
alliance
technology
should
align
itself
instead
with
the
userworker
this
acknowledges
the
knowledgepower
of
technology
itself
if
it
is
authored
by
management
this
is
a
first
step
in
recognizing
the
question
of
who
should
author
a
system
but
it
does
not
acknowledge
the
powerknowledge
of
the
developer
that
still
exists
in
participatory
design
i
e
the
possession
of
the
technical
languages
including
code
the
first
and
most
crucial
reflection
is
that
the
user
must
be
figured
into
the
design
process
even
when
the
designer
responds
to
a
call
to
empower
the
user
or
support
the
users
actions
design
of
technology
always
imagines
use
and
figures
a
user
often
the
rhetoric
of
participatory
design
and
other
design
methods
that
are
conscious
of
the
conflict
struggles
with
this
tension
some
generalizable
use
is
maintained
and
this
upsets
the
idealized
relationship
between
the
designer
and
user
whether
the
design
process
refigures
the
user
as
a
participant
or
an
actor
the
word
user
fails
to
fall
away
we
would
like
to
consider
the
user
as
a
figure
because
it
enables
us
to
see
the
design
process
as
a
narrative
in
which
the
user
is
the
primary
figure
an
alternative
response
then
is
not
to
remove
the
user
but
to
refigure
or
mutate
the
user
but
continue
to
see
the
user
as
central
to
the
narrative
we
can
see
how
participatory
design
and
other
usercentered
projects
are
attempts
to
refigure
the
user
often
it
seems
that
the
new
processes
have
been
achieved
but
that
the
refiguring
of
the
user
has
in
some
senses
failed
a
figure
collects
up
the
people
a
figure
embodies
shared
meanings
in
stories
that
inhabit
their
audiences
if
we
understand
current
approaches
to
technology
design
as
narratives
we
can
already
see
that
the
user
is
a
figure
that
collects
up
the
people
the
user
collects
up
the
selection
of
people
who
are
seen
to
be
the
receivers
of
technology
while
designers
may
select
particular
users
to
involve
in
the
design
process
the
userfigure
clearly
points
to
the
collection
of
all
people
who
will
be
users
which
will
inevitably
include
the
designers
themselves
the
userfigure
embodies
shared
meanings
of
use
within
the
contested
space
of
what
users
and
designers
make
of
the
technology
being
designed
in
technology
design
the
designer
has
legitimate
authority
over
the
object
world
of
designed
objects
but
this
authority
does
not
follow
the
same
modesty
of
the
scientific
author
the
designer
no
matter
the
efforts
to
empower
users
is
one
who
intervenes
through
the
technology
she
creates
the
designer
is
at
times
expressive
through
the
medium
of
technological
innovation
at
other
times
especially
in
much
of
design
methodology
the
focus
shifts
to
the
user
and
the
designer
as
a
subject
recedes
from
view
however
in
what
the
designer
knows
and
in
how
she
intervenes
she
is
immodest
and
in
the
modes
through
which
the
designer
tries
to
achieve
objectivity
e
g
through
a
focus
on
the
user
she
is
immodest
using
the
lens
of
authorship
we
can
further
analyze
this
immodest
role
of
the
designer
whose
voice
remains
authorial
even
if
there
are
moves
to
limit
that
voice
the
immodesty
begins
to
make
sense
once
we
realize
that
designs
authorial
voice
has
not
yet
stabilized
in
the
way
that
the
scientific
author
has
and
designers
as
a
whole
are
ambivalent
or
take
conflicting
views
on
the
designers
role
as
an
author
whether
to
be
expressive
or
selfinvisible
and
attempts
to
place
the
designer
in
the
selfinvisible
mode
of
the
modest
witness
are
ultimately
unsuccessful
because
of
the
technical
skill
required
to
author
the
technology
to
which
in
most
cases
only
the
designer
has
access
literature
on
participatory
design
and
scenarios
both
consider
the
need
to
get
software
and
design
professionals
to
step
out
of
their
role
and
into
a
new
role
this
is
one
way
in
which
the
user
is
clearly
a
figure
a
role
that
can
be
taken
on
by
the
design
professional
who
chooses
to
step
out
of
his
role
can
software
professionals
recognize
and
affirm
the
validity
of
perspectives
other
than
their
own
and
value
the
expertise
that
comes
from
experience
not
just
the
knowledge
that
is
attested
by
academic
credentials
this
acknowledges
a
kind
of
common
sense
notion
that
software
professionals
need
to
be
disciplined
to
seek
outside
perspectives

five
reasons

that

a
sense

the

is
figured
as

kind

technical
professionals
are
intelligent
people
performing
complex
and
openended
tasks
they
want
to
reflect
on
their
activities
and
they
routinely
do
reflect
on
their
activities
but
they
require
an
extra
push
to
surmount
that
higher
peak

reflect

the
nontechnical
nonprofessional
user

herodesigner
must
pander

as
having
expertise
about
his
own
experience
in
both
participatory
design
and
other
usercentered
design
expertise
of
experience
is
a
substitute
word
for
subjectivity
and
still
poses
the
designer
as
residing
in
the
world
of
objectivity
but
needing
to
reflect
on
the
subjective
world
in
which
his
work
will
ultimately
reside
techniques
to
step
out
of
the
role
of
designer
or
to
communicate
with
real
users
are
often
narrative
in
form
there
are
scenarios
which
attempt
to
provide
plain
english
accounts
of
use
in
a
chronological
ordering
like
a
story
or
more
accurately
like
one
cohesive
scene
in
a
story
scenarios
are
most
often
written
by
developers
after
meeting
with
a
customer
or
user
and
are
then
provided
back
to
the
user
or
customer
for
verification
or
even
as
a
contract
for
work
user
stories
in
extreme
programming
another
software
process
are
also
used
as
small
units
of
work
that
are
agreed
upon
in
an
iterative
weekly
meeting
and
which
describe
features
in
the
language
of
the
user
the
discomfort
of
reflection
in
the
design
process
is
noted
and
is
moderated
in
the
techniques
of
scenarios
and
personas
by
a
mutation
of
the
user
into
something
that
the
developer
has
authored
and
created
the
user
as
a
persona
or
within
the
plot
of
a
scenario
is
generic
and
though
this
figure
can
make
the
designer
uncomfortable
he
is
ultimately
a
phantom
of
the
designers
own
mind
and
thus
the
designer
remains
in
control
the
designer
is
described
as
being
brought
into
an
intimate
engagement
with
the
concrete
elements
of
the
situation
the
situation
that
belongs
to
the
user
and
is
obtained
by
a
reflection
on
the
experience
of
the
user
an
intimacy
with
the
person
who
will
use
the
system
appears
too
dangerous
to
request
of
the
designer
the
subjectivity
of
the
user
is
again
removed
the
intimacy
that
the
designer
should
aim
to
achieve
is
with
concrete
elements
of
the
situation
i
e
something
objective
about
the
subjectivity
the
designer
requires
something
objective
to
take
away
in
order
to
design
this
is
especially
seen
in
the
use
of
personas
in
the
design
process
personas
are
a
literary
technique
first
adopted
in
marketing
and
then
in
product
design
and
ultimately
in
largescale
software
design
projects
grudin
says
that
personas
can
be
used
to
make
up
for
some
shortcomings
of
usercentered
design
and
scenarios
particularly
in
largescale
projects
often
these
projects
require
a
specialist
group
e

academic
researchers
to
spend
time
with
users
to
study
interview
and
observe
them
but

to
center
design
around
real
users
fails
to
engage
the
designers
a
solution
is
personas
personas
are
fictional
people
they
have
names
likenesses
clothes
occupations
families
friends
pets
possessions
and
so
forth
they
have
age
gender
ethnicity
educational
achievement
and
socioeconomic
status
they
have
life
stories
goals
and
tasks
designers
can
author
personas
without
any
basis
on
real
users
but
grudin
does
not
recommend
this
in
many
cases
personas
are
authored
after
extensive
data
collection
about
real
users
as
a
way
to
represent
the
data
in
a
more
engaging
way
personas
are
seen
to
take
on
a
life
of
their
own
or
take
over
the
design
process
at
the
sigchi
conference
james
nieters
of
cisco
gave
a
report
entitled
making
personas
memorable
cutout
dolls
of
personas
used
by
cisco
were
provided
to
conferencegoers
as
takehome
souvenirs
nieters
said
that
one
of
the
benefits
of
personas
is
that
no
one
asks
for
the
data
that
back
them
up
these
very
deliberate
figurations
of
the
user
into
personas
seem
to
resolve
the
conflict
of
broken
communication
between
the
user
and
designer
personas
speak
to
engineers
in
a
way
that
real
users
cannot
but
personas
are
also
a
way
to
elide
the
issue
of
authorship
the
user
is
kept
at
a
great
distance
from
the
design
and
is
in
fact
authored
into
a
persona
before
having
a
voice
in
the
design
process
the
designer
thus
behaves
as
a
ventriloquist
for
the
user
as
objectworld
the
persona
that
the
designer
authored
is
inverted
in
the
hierarchy
such
that
the
userfigure
is
in
control
of
the
design
but
is
not
a
threat
to
authorship
haraway
says
that
the
modest
witness
is
the
legitimate
and
authorized
ventriloquist
for
the
object
world
adding
nothing
from
his
mere
opinions
from
his
biasing
embodiment
the
designer
fits
the
role
of
an
immodest
witness
because
he
is
the
authorized
ventriloquist
for
the
user
world
but
his
opinions
and
biases
are
what
figure
him
as
the
author
of
the
designed
technology
this
immodesty
is
a
paradoxical
dilemma
unlike
the
modest
witness
the
designer
is
incapable
of
selfinvisibility
he
must
step
out
of
the
way
for
the
user
to
speak
the
needs
of
the
system
he
must
ventriloquize
this
speech
modestly
but
then
he
must
become
visible
in
the
same
moment
through
his
authorship
of
the
technology
that
justifies
the
design
process
in
participatory
design
there
is
a
clear
reframing
of
software
design
as
a
political
process
that
involves
a
conflict
of
expertise
and
as
a
politics
of
knowledgecreation
it
also
frames
participation
in
the
design
process
as
not
mere
involvement
muller
also
acknowledges
that
participation
in
the
design
process
is
an
issue
of
communication
through
language
or
through
artifacts
however
muller
also
creates
a
taxonomy
of
participatory
design
practice
that
poses
a
dual
axis
of
practice
based
how
early
or
late
the
user
participates
in
the
design
process
and
how
much
the
user
participates
in
the
world
of
the
designerhow
much
the
designer
participates
in
the
world
of
the
user
what
is
maintained
in
all
these
rhetorics
is
the
underlying
and
underacknowledged
desire
of
the
designer
to
create
new
ways
of
doing
things
and
new
things
to
do
in
distancing
the
designer
from
his
desire
design
methods
create
a
tension
between
relinquishing
control
through
in
order
to
understand
the
real
situation
of
the
users
and
retaining
an
authorial
vision
i
e
the
authorship
of
the
design
but
this
sets
up
a
conflict
that
cannot
be
resolved
how
can
a
designer
create
new
ways
of
doing
things
and
new
things
to
do
if
they
are
accountable
to
the
current
ways
that
users
do
things
and
the
current
things
that
users
do
the
role
of
the
designer
can
be
seen
as
one
of
a
certain
expertise
in
conflict
with
a
different
expertise
of
the
user
but
there
is
more
to
the
role
of
the
designer
than
this
kind
of
expertise
ultimately
designers
are
good
at
envisioning
use
at
imagining
and
bringing
into
being
new
uses
and
new
ways
to
use
while
the
framing
of
design
as
embedded
within
economic
and
political
projects
allows
the
designer
to
consider
the
obligation
to
empower
the
user
as
a
workersubject
it
does
not
allow
us
to
consider
the
conflict
of
authorship
one
can
involve
the
user
in
the
design
process
at
any
stage
and
can
migrate
the
designer
to
the
world
of
the
user
or
the
user
to
the
world
of
the
designer
but
the
authorship
of
the
technology
remains
an
unresolved
conflict
implications
translation
or
refiguration
this
reframing
of
technology
design
as
technical
authorship
leads
to
the
breakdown
of
the
designer
into
the
roles
of
expert
author
and
especially
translator
between
the
technical
and
nontechnical
or
popular
languages
it
lays
out
a
different
set
of
obligations
and
accountabilities
for
the
designer
of
technology
not
only
can
we
work
to
make
the
user
and
the
designer
subjects
in
design
practice
technical
experts
could
succeed
in
bridging
the
gap
between
designers
and
users
by
defining
a
new
obligation
to
translate
technical
languages
and
promote
technical
literacy
however
haraway
also
warns
us
that
there
is
no
way
to
rationality
to
actually
existing
worlds
outside
stories
not
for
our
species
anyway
that
is
we
should
be
wary
of
defiguring
as
a
route
to
coauthorship
within
science
studies
she
suggests
that
we
should
not
unmask
the
modest
witness
storytelling
is
the
only
way
that
we
know
about
the
natural
world
and
so
the
figure
of
the
modest
witness
affords
us
a
place
to
begin
telling
stories
about
the
world
if
we
strip
the
empirical
individual
of
his
figures
how
will
he
continue
his
practice
all
the
more
so
we
should
be
wary
of
tossing
out
the
immodest
witness
or
userfigure
if
storytelling
is
the
only
way
we
can
understand
the
natural
world
as
haraway
contends
then
it
is
most
certainly
the
only
way
that
we
can
come
to
conceive
of
future
worlds
we
wish
to
create
refiguring
the
immodest
witness
is
important
in
order
for
reflective
and
critical
design
practices
to
continue
to
emerge
and
grow
and
the
userfigure
should
certainly
not
be
dealt
with
rashly
because
he
is
designs
primary
figure
that
distinguishes
design
from
science
if
the
sciences
had
a
figure
outside
of
nature
herself
to
contend
with
perhaps
the
sciences
would
be
better
off
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
userfigure
does
not
need
reshaping
but
perhaps
we
should
embrace
the
creative
methods
found
in
personas
and
the
user
stories
of
agile
software
development
as
ways
to
refigure
and
reshape
design
by
reframing
the
conflict
of
the
userdesigner
relationship
as
one
of
authorship
we
find
a
way
that
the
user
and
the
designer
can
forge
a
different
relationship
this
aim
aligns
with
projects
for
usercentered
design
and
participatory
design
that
seek
a
noninstrumentalized
usersubject
but
also
departs
from
these
through
the
consideration
of
the
userfigure
as
central
and
indispensable
to
narratives
of
technical
futures
through
the
mutation
of
the
userfigure
the
qualities
that
divide
the
designerfigure
from
the
userfigure
fall
into
several
roles
that
are
commonly
conflated
that
of
the
author
expert
and
translator
while
the
politics
of
the
user
has
been
highlighted
in
various
rhetorics
these
have
failed
to
acknowledge
the
conflict
as
one
of
contested
authorship
these
projects
that
explicitly
express
concern
for
the
user
nonetheless
maintain
authorial
control
of
the
technology
in
the
hands
of
the
designer
if
the
user
is
the
primary
figure
of
the
authored
narrative
then
the
user
as
usersubject
stands
in
the
way
of
authorship
while
at
the
same
time
being
the
instrument
for
discovering
an
objective
use
and
the
one
whose
needs
must
be
satisfied
this
is
an
impossible
position
for
the
designer
who
is
lead
into
a
figurative
heros
journey
by
considering
the
conflict
of
the
userdesigner
relationship
as
one
of
authorship
we
are
able
to
highlight
the
user
as
the
primary
figure
of
the
authored
work
current
design
methodologies
can
be
examined
to
understand
this
figure
the
user
this
reframing
provides
the
possibility
of
considering
the
coauthorship
of
technology
not
as
the
codesign
of
technology
it
leads
to
the
breakdown
of
the
designer
into
the
roles
of
expert
contested
author
and
translator
between
the
technical
and
nontechnical
languages
it
lays
out
a
different
set
of
obligations
and
accountabilities
for
the
designer
of
technology
coauthorship
of
technical
futures
retain
the
user
as
the
central
figure
but
place
the
nondesigner
as
a
coauthor
of
the
narrative
the
userfigure
inhabits
including
the
authorship
of
a
mutated
userfigure
the
designer
plays
the
role
of
technical
expert
but
also
translator
the
reframing
of
the
problem
as
one
of
authorship
reminds
us
that
expertise
is
not
the
only
mode
of
authorship
that
authorship
is
not
the
only
means
for
the
designer
to
play
a
role
and
that
translation
is
vital
to
the
political
project
of
building
technical
futures
in
all
cases
where
the
user
is
figured
into
the
design
process
or
is
refigured
as
an
actor
expert
knowledgemaker
meaningmaker
or
participant
the
attempt
to
avoid
instrumentalization
fails
to
some
degree
this
is
because
the
user
is
a
figure
of
technology
design
of
technology
of
the
technical
and
techne
the
user
is
a
figure
the
focal
character
in
a
narrative
of
imagined
future
uses
no
design
process
can
fail
to
imagine
future
uses
practices
of
technology
design
that
do
not
instrumentalize
the
user
are
seen
in
approaches
where
authorship
is
highlighted
in
the
case
of
artistic
or
critical
technology
design
where
the
user
is
a
figure
and
not
intended
to
inhabit
a
real
person
it
is
also
seen
in
the
abandonment
of
the
user
when
designers
design
for
designers
as
is
seen
in
the
hackers
and
opensource
movements
the
opensource
movement
as
kelty
discusses
in
his
article
on
recursive
publics
tends
towards
a
mutation
technology
authorship
copyleft
and
other
opensource
practices
are
antiauthorial
extreme
programming
which
is
an
approach
to
software
development
was
fashioned
as
a
set
or
practices
to
empower
software
developers
in
the
face
of
too
many
demands
and
requirements
from
users
it
is
not
often
highlighted
that
this
approach
also
takes
a
stance
against
authorship
of
code
a
key
principle
is
that
the
code
belongs
to
everyone
additionally
stories
are
used
to
translate
needs
of
users
into
test
cases
and
test
cases
translate
easily
into
code
grudin
points
out
that
personas
are
effective
because
they
are
a
technique
that
can
draw
upon
powerful
psychological
forces
to
restore
these
dimensions
of
engagement
complexity
representation
and
identity
in
this
and
his
discussion
of
fiction
grudin
acknowledges
what
haraway
says
that
there
is
no
way
to
rationalityto
actually
existing
worldsoutside
stories
not
for
our
species
anyway
but
the
success
of
personas
and
other
kinds
of
narrative
devices
in
the
design
process
should
not
be
used
as
a
wedge
between
the
user
and
the
developer
instead
this
should
form
a
recognition
that
the
userfigure
is
central
and
is
always
authored
with
or
without
data
collection
the
user
figure
should
not
be
put
to
sleep
but
should
be
mutated
as
haraway
suggests
with
the
mutation
of
the
sciences
modest
witness
this
mutation
happens
through
the
focus
on
technology
design
as
technology
authorship
adrian
johns
discusses
how
authorship
in
the
sciences
was
crafted
over
time
the
modern
authorial
persona
was
shaped
through
shifts
in
policing
property
bibliographical
classification
and
finally
understandings
of
the
creative
process
in
design
the
creative
process
is
one
of
the
primary
narratives
and
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
fictional
methods
have
been
deployed
in
design
while
they
have
been
extricated
from
the
scientific
authorial
voice
stories
are
already
a
part
of
design
but
they
are
fictional
methods
to
convey
profound
truths
when
they
ought
to
be
fictional
methods
to
convey
profound
fictions
those
who
write
about
a
critical
technical
practice
in
technology
design
such
as
phoebe
sengers
draw
attention
these
narratives
of
future
use
but
the
userfigure
is
not
central
to
these
narratives
as
much
as
the
technology
which
instantiates
future
uses
that
were
previously
unknown
the
userfigure
is
mutated
from
its
original
role
because
it
is
now
distinct
from
the
empirical
users
is
maintained
as
the
central
figure
is
more
radically
subjective
but
also
intersubjective
the
cats
cradle
that
haraway
discusses
requires
a
back
and
forth
between
the
designer
and
nondesigner
in
shaping
knots
and
paths
that
will
make
up
the
narrative
of
technical
futures
the
coauthors
are
the
players
of
the
game
and
should
not
be
tied
up
in
its
knots
the
user
figure
is
the
usemaker
to
draw
on
the
idea
of
knowledgemaker
he
is
the
character
in
a
story
of
rainmaking
the
one
who
brings
about
rain
by
inhabiting
a
story
that
imitates
the
rain
and
is
the
rain
the
userfigure
can
be
to
the
modest
witness
what
the
white
rabbit
is
to
alice
or
the
fool
to
the
magus
the
one
who
is
