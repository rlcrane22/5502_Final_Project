and
asks
whats
missing
from
these

his
answer
reading
is
now
missing
from
countless
scenes
it
once

dominated
at
kitchen
tables
on
buses
and
trains
in
beds
at
night
on

couches
even
in
some
classrooms
|||
p
|||
reading
of
literature
in
particular
is
less
present
in
american
|||
lives
according
to
a
national
endowment
for
the
arts
survey
which
in

identified
an
overall
decline
of
percentage
points
in
literary

readers
from
to
representing
a
loss
of
million
potential
|||
readers
|||
at
the
same
time
scholars
of
print
culture
have
produced
|||
quantities
of
studies
|||
of
reading
both
current
and
historical
|||
the
work
on
current
reading
|||
practices
often
uses
ethnographic
methods
to
observe
and
interview
|||
readers
while
the
historical
studies
draw
on
the
customary
sources
of
|||
historians
archival
and
published
texts
to
reconstruct
readers
and
|||
their
experiences
|||
their
work

the
political
social

individual
and
cultural
functions
uses
and
meanings
of

in

diverse
circumstances
and
locales
|||
reading
would
at
first
glance
seem
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
|||
collaborative
or
distributed
tagging
of
information
resources
|||
especially
images
|||
both
are
of
interest
to
researchers
and
teachers
of

library
and
information
science
lis
albeit
to
different
and
probably
|||
not
overlapping
communities
of
interest
despite
the
fact
that
neither
|||
reading
nor
tagging
is
considered
core
to
lis
paradigms
or
to
the
lis
|||
curriculum
|||
print
culture
theorists
understand
reading
as
both
|||
a
solitary
and
a
social
act
|||
similarly
social
tagging
of
information
|||
resources
has
both
individual
and
social
aspects
|||
one
place
where
|||
reading
and
tagging
come
together

images

a
new
body
of
documentation
for
print
culture
scholars
who
typically
|||
have
relied
on
the
word
to
study
the
word
but
they
also
offer
a
body
of
|||
data
for
lis
researchers
interested
in
understanding
the
phenomenon
of

collaborative

what
it

she
suggests
that

may
help

the
semantic
gap
between

with
its

project
designed

graphic

the

focuses
on

this

will
serve
as
a

for
further

into
the

as
social
acts

also

approximately

are

the
number

fluctuates

and
as
existing

are

a
simple
keyword
search
of
the
full

of

for

yields

more

results
after
deleting
those

the

this

the

the
total

a

and
stacks

or

or
shelves
of

|||
the
researcher
viewed
each
of
the

images
and
their
tags
and
recorded
and
tabulated
the
tags
|||
to
address
mitchell
stephenss
assertion
about
where
reading
occurs
|||
additional
searches
were
conducted
using
keywords
such
as
train
bus
|||
and
airplane
combined
with
book
and
limited
to
tags
only
|||
the
point
is
|||
not
to
prove
that
books
still
have
a
place
in
the
information
age
as
|||
evidenced
by
their
robust
representation
on
a
photosharing
site
but
to
|||
explore
what
constitutes
reading
to
the
collective
mind
of
flickr

image
taggers
and
to
elicit
questions
for
further
investigation
|||
findings
and
analysis
|||
although
this
study
is
limited
to
images
tagged
with
both
reading
and

many
other

related

are

some
of
them

as

by
most
to
least
common
|||
the
singular
form
|||
book
is
the
most
commonly
used
tag
but
it
is
not
clear
that
every
image
|||
tagged
with
the
term
is
using
that
keyword
to
mean
the
printed
codex
|||
what
is
clear
is
that
some
photographs
tagged
with
the
term
book
do
not
|||
depict
a
book
at
all
but
merely
evoke
the
idea
of
a
book
such
as
the
|||
image
of
a
young
man
looking
down
or
of
a
solitary
bookmark
|||
not
surprisingly
more
specific

such
as

the

is
interesting
in
and

of
itself

its
commonplace
for
library
and
information
science
lis
|||
practitioners
and
researchers
to
assert
that
tags
are
akin
to
subject

headings

terms
but
the
tag
me
arose
out
of
social

and
not
out
of
formal
expert
controlledvocabulary
construction

for

those
of

the
tag
me
seems
superfluous
at
best

and
downright
nonsensical
given
its
ambiguity
and
its
seeming
lack
of

utility

table
does
not
indicate
whats
most
striking
about
the
ways
in
which

images
related
to

are
tagged
because
it
does
not
list
the
|||
tags
assigned
to

one

in
the

these

unique

range

|||
many
of
them
are

the
first
names
of

others

are
the
titles
and
authors
of
the
books
depicted

as
with
the

such
as
library
and
studying
some
of
these
singleuse
terms

seem
highly
correlated
to
the
reading
of

for
example
the
terms

include
literary
festival
and
author
event
|||
other
terms
such
as
the

active
sailing
and
the
passive
sleeping
seem
incompatible
with
the
act
|||
of
reading
|||
the
tags
for
the
sample
of
images
do
not
quite
address
mitchell
|||
stephenss
assertion
that
it
is
rare
to
find
people
reading
in
public
|||
or
private
spaces
|||
the
sample
set
is
small
relative
to
the
total
number

of

on

and
people
do
not
tag
in
a
systematic
manner
|||
requiring
them
to
make
sure
every
object
shown
in
a
photograph
has
a
|||
corresponding
tag
|||
but
a
search
in
all
of
flickr
combining
the
tag
book
|||
with
other
tags

a

of

perhaps
they

it

questions
that

that
i

plan
to
pursue
as
a

of
this

what

are

what

interpret

from

not

indications

which

are

in

related
to

and
reading
which
authors
are
represented
which
specific
book
titles
|||
and
which
categories
of
books
are
shown
and
in
what
proportion
what
|||
impact
does
a
media
event
such
as
the
release
of
a
harry
potter
book
|||
have
on
the
number
and
type
of

published
|||
how
do
the
titles
and
captions
and
comments
supplement
or
subvert
the

tags
assigned
to
photos
how
does
the
photostream
andor
themed
set
in

which
the
photo
appears
alter
the
viewers
understanding
of
the
photo
|||
to
what
extent
are
photos
of
reading
staged
versus
candid
to
what

extent
is
the
book
a
prop
what
is
the
function
of
the
book
as

propfor
creating
a
particular
selfimage
or
for
product
or
author
or

bookstore
or

promotion
or
to
evoke
the
centuriesold
symbol
of

literacy
or
revolution
or
erudition
|||
the
last
set
of
questions
will
require
surveying
andor
interviewing

photographers
|||
the
remaining
questions
can
be
answered
largely
through

the
use
of
good
data
gathering
and
analytic

|||
flickr
is
a
popular
and
successful
social
networking
site
and
its
|||
features
serve
its
users
well
|||
but
the
researcher
needs
different
kinds
|||
of
features
and
functions
|||
the
large
number
of
unique
tags
assigned
to
|||
photos
the
lack
of
a
highly
developed
search
engine
with
full
boolean
|||
operations
and
truncation
devices
and
the
absence
of
a
controlled
|||
vocabulary
of
indexing
terms
hamper
the
researchers
ability
to
|||
retrieve
a
reliable
and
accurate
set
of
results
depicting
reading
|||
consequently
the
datagathering
and
analysis
methods
used
in
subsequent
|||
work
on
this
topic
should
include
researchergenerated
indexing
terms
|||
for
each
image
being
studied
|||
this
approach
would
introduce
muchneeded
|||
consistency
for
example
a
photo
of
someone
reading
in
the
aisles
at
|||
borders
and
another
of
a
reader
sitting
in
a
chair
at
barnes
noble
|||
would
both
be
assigned
a
controlledvocabulary
term
such
as
|||
bookstore
|||
this
approach
would
also
allow
not
only
for
greater
|||
consistency
but
also
for
comprehensiveness
at
least
for
the
|||
researchers
interests
|||
for
instance
a
photo
of
a
person
sitting
on
|||
the
grass
in
a
city
park
would
probably
never
be
tagged
public
but
|||
the
researcher
interested
in
making
a
distinction
between
reading
in
|||
public
and
reading
in
private
would
find
such
a
tag
useful
|||
finally
the
researchers
work
should
be
grounded
not
only
in
the
|||
literature
of
social
tagging
but
in
the
theory
of
the
social
uses
of
|||
photography
and
in
work
on
the
intersection
of
print
and
digital
|||
culture
|||
conclusion
|||
the
practices
of
sharing
digital
images
and
providing
collaborative
|||
tagging
to
describe
images
have
created
an
intriguing
body
of
work
that
|||
can
be
mined
for
information
related
to
many
topics
not
least
of
which
|||
is
the
topic
of
books
and
reading
in
the
era
of
digital
information
|||
but
|||
neither
images
nor
their
labels
offer
unambiguous
evidence
for
the
|||
persistence
of
the
printed
codex
its
relative
presence
in
peoples
|||
lives
or
the
uses
to
which
it
is
put
|||
a
preliminary
look
at
a
selection
|||
of
digital
photos
tagged
book
and
reading
suggests
that
with
carefully
|||
crafted
research
methods
both
image
and
word
can
be
studied
together
to
|||
help
us
understand
individual
and
social
uses
of
reading
or
perhaps
|||
more
accurately
individual
and
social
uses
of
representations
