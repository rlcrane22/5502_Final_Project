paper

annual

|||
the
sustained
knowledge
building
of
virtual
groups
and
online
communities
requires
that
coparticipants
overcome
a
wide
range
of
gaps
in
their
interactions
especially
in
the
context
of
|||
longterm
activity
across
multiple
episodes
and
collectivities

here
we
present
an
analysis
of

the
collective
information

virtual

our

in
this

knowledge
building
is

primarily
information
activity

out

naturally
knowledge
building
is
a
complex
and
challenging
enterprise
|||
divergent

perspectives
often
lead
to
problems
of
understanding
different
work
styles
can
result
in

interactional
breakdowns
while
the
distributed
nature
of
joint
action
over
time
usually
|||
leads
to
gaps
of
awareness
and
problems
of
coordination
|||
discontinuities
emerging
from

longterm
knowledge

been
studied
from
a
number
of
different

despite
their

most

have
concentrated

of

who
successfully
overcome

but
few

descriptions
have
been
offered
of
the

among
these

the

httpmathforum

is
an
online

active
since

it

promotes

among

mathematicians

interested

as
the
math

continues

innovative
use

in
the
vmt
project
small
groups
of
students
come

together
to
work
through
a
special
online

that
provides
them
with
an

during
the
spring
of
and
we
conducted
two
case
studies
of
vmt
activity
to
|||
explore
issues
of
continuity
and
sustainability
of
collaborative
knowledge
building
|||
in
|||
each
case
five
virtual
teams
were
formed
with
about
four
noncollocated
secondaryschool
students
selected
by
volunteer
teachers
at
different
schools
across
the
united
|||
states
|||
the
teams
engaged
in
online
math
discussions
for
four
hourlong
sessions
over
a
|||
twoweek
period
|||
they
used
the
vmt
virtual
room
environment
wessner
et
al
|||
which
combines
a
persistent
chat
tool
with
a
shared
whiteboard
in
addition
to
some
other
|||
interactional
supports
|||
at
the
start
the
teams
were
given
a
brief
description
of
an
openended
mathematical
situation
and
were
encouraged
to
generate
and
pursue
their
own
|||
questions
about
it
|||
later
on
the
teams
were
given
feedback
on
their
prior
work
and
the
|||
work
of
other
teams
and
were
encouraged
to
continue
their
work
|||
the
goals
of
our
analysis
were
to
understand
how
teams
of
participants
in
the
vmt
|||
online
community
managed
the
apparent
discontinuity
of
their
interactions
e
|||
g
|||
multiple
|||
collaborative
sessions
teams
and
tasks
and
to
explore
the
relationship
between
such
|||
activity
and
the
teams
knowledge
building
over
time
|||
we
employed
the
approach
of
|||
ethnomethodology
garfinkel
to
examine
the
sequences
of
events
by
using
|||
recordings
and
artifacts
from
each
team
sessions
|||
as
part
of
the
phenomenological
|||
perspective
ethnomethodology
is
based
on
naturalistic
inquiry
to
inductively
and
|||
holistically
understand
human
experience
in
contextspecific
settings
patton
|||
for
|||
our
purposes
we
examined
each
of
the
sessions
recorded
paying
special
attention
to
|||
the
sequential
unfolding
of
the
problemsolving
episodes
in
which
each
team
participated
|||
constant
comparison
through
the
entire
dataset
led
to
our
refinement
of
the
structural
|||
elements
that
define
the
information
practices
presented
below
|||
information
practices
local
longitudinal
and
expansive
continuity
|||
our
study
of
bridging
practices
revealed
a
series
of
information
practices
which
allowed
|||
the
teams
to
cross
over
the
boundaries
of
time
and
link
together
different
episodes
of
|||
collective
action
|||
the
three
most
significant
practices
documented
in
our
analysis
are
|||
framing
narratives
of
past
activity
as
resources
for
new
tasks
collective
remembering
|||
and
projective
memory
|||
by
framing
narratives
of
past
activity
as
resources
for
new
tasks
teams
were
able
to
|||
construct
and
use
reportables
such
as
rules
procedures
or
results
that
had
been
|||
discovered
in
prior
activities
and
construct
new
tasks
for
their
current
activity
|||
in
doing
|||
this
participants
seemed
to
contribute
to
the
creation
of
a
team
history
constructed
out
of
|||
episodes
of
interaction
and
the
relevant
team
members
biographies
|||
projective
memory
|||
the
least
common
of
the
three
practices
documented
involved
the
planning
and
|||
configuration
of
future
work
out
of
incomplete
work
e
|||
g
|||
missing
explanations
further
|||
challenges
e
|||
g
|||
more
complex
problems
or
possible
new
tasks
|||
finally
through
|||
collective
remembering
participants
and
nonparticipants
of
prior
activities
engaged
in
|||
reconstructing
past
results
by
juxtaposing
past
and
present
resources
and
in
many
cases
|||
advancing
the
frontiers
of
prior
results
|||
these
information
practices
seemed
to
have
one
interesting
structural
feature
in
common
|||
they
were
deployed
by
interweaving
three
central
aspects
of
the
groups
interactions
|||
time
and
sequences
of
activity
participation
frameworks
and
knowledge
artifacts
|||
the
|||
temporal
or
sequential
organization
of
experience
i
|||
e
|||
what
was
done
in
a
different
|||
episode
of
activity
or
at
a
different
time
how
does
one
action
relates
to
something
done
|||
before
etc
|||
provided
the
underlying
structure
for
the
teams
to
construct
a
sense
of
|||
continuity
that
was
local
within
an
episode
of
interaction
longitudinal
as
it
related
to
|||
the
history
of
the
team
and
expansive
as
it
projected
towards
the
past
and
future
|||
activities
of
other
groups
in
the
online
community
|||
by
enacting
specific
participation
|||
frameworks
e
|||
g
|||
positioning
participants
as
being
or
not
involved
in
a
specific
past
|||
present
or
future
activity
as
those
who
can
or
should
speak
about
a
particular
matter
etc
|||
teams
managed
their
ongoing
dynamic
interactions
and
the
creation
and
management
of
|||
knowledge
artifacts
such
as
tasks
and
other
problemsolving
resources
|||
these
three
|||
elements
were
central
to
the
information
practices
related
to
continuity
|||
in
summary
bridging
activity
allowed
the
teams
to
cross
over
the
boundaries
of
time
|||
activities
collectivities
or
perspectives
|||
bridging
then
seems
to
define
a
set
of
|||
information
practices
through
which
participants
deal
with
the
discontinuities
relevant
to
|||
their
joint
activity
|||
another
way
to
describe
bridging
might
be
to
say
that
they
are
|||
concerned
with
what
roschelle
and
teasley
described
as
the
construction
and
|||
maintenance
of
a
joint
problem
space
|||
originally
this
space
was
theorized
as
a
shared
|||
knowledge
structure
that
integrated
goals
descriptions
of
the
current
problem
state
and
|||
the
awareness
of
available
problem
solving
actions
|||
in
our
case
we
have
seen
that
this
|||
joint
problem
space
is
significantly
distributed
over
time
across
participants
and
artifacts
|||
and
also
that
specific
information
practices
are
related
to
its
construction
maintenance
|||
and
use
|||
the
successful
construction
and
maintenance
of
a
joint
problem
space
constitutes
a
|||
central
challenge
of
effective
collaborative
knowledge
building
roschelle

|||
several
studies
in
the
field
of
computersupported
|||
collaborative
learning
have
shown
that
the
interactional
manner
in
which
this
|||
intersubjective
problem
space
is
created
and
used
determines
the
success
of
the

collaborative

our

analysis
has
shown
that
this
challenge
escalates
in
contexts
characterized
by
longitudinal
|||
activity
across
multiple
collectivities
but
that
specific
information
practices
can
be
|||
deployed
for
teams
to
manage
this
complexity

to
establish
continuity
and
sustainability
