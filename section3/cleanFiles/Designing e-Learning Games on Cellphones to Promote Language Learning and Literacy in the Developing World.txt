designing
elearning
games
on
cellphones
to
|||
promote
language
learning
and
literacy
in
the
developing
world
|||
literacy
is
one
of
the
great
challenges
in
the
developing
world
|||
even
more
challenging
is
the
|||
tension
between
regional
and
world
languages
that
economic
opportunities
are
often
closed
|||
to
those
who
are
literate
only
in
a
regional
language
|||
india
for
instance
is
a
country
with
|||
regional
and
two
national
languages
hindi
and
english
|||
but
for
most
practical
purposes
|||
english
is
the
language
of
economic
opportunity
|||
it
is
the
language
of
instruction
in
private
|||
schools
and
all
universities
a
large
fraction
of
business
and
government
and
the
language
which
|||
is
driving
indias
service
economy
the
fastest
growing
in
the
world
|||
fluency
in
english
can
|||
almost
be
equated
with
membership
in
the
middle
and
upper
classes
|||
the
value
of
english
is
|||
widely
recognized
by
ordinary
indians
and
it
is
the
poorest
citizens
who
are
lobbying
most
|||
strongly
to
expand
english
teaching
|||
a
recent
article
states
that
mastery
of
english
is
the
single
|||
most
influential
factor
that
determines
access
to
elite
educational
institutions
and
hence
to
|||
important
avenues
of
economic
and
social
advancement
|||
more
broadly
the
literature
e
|||
g
|||
our
conversations
with
development
professionals
in
africa
|||
latin
america
and
asia
and
further
experiences
in
the
field
indicate
that
a
large
proportion
of
|||
lowincome
people
want
to
improve
their
command
of
an
appropriate
world
language
|||
english
|||
is
certainly
one
of
these
as
is
mandarin
chinese
and
spanish
|||
but
even
in
countries
where
such
a
|||
language
is
an
official
national
language
many
speakers
inevitably
the
least
empowered
|||
have
a
different
native
language
and
many
regional
languages
let
alone
dialects
are
often
|||
spoken
|||
in
india
hindi
and
english
are
official
national
languages
but
hindi
is
native
to
only
|||
of
the
population
|||
world
language
fluency
opens
the
door
to
further
education
a
larger
|||
regional
or
world
marketplace
to
new
economy
outsourced
jobs
and
often
improves
access
|||
to
government
health
and
legal
services
|||
our
current
work
concentrates
on
esl
english
as
a
second
language
but
we
believe
many
of
|||
the
lessons
will
transfer
to
other
wsl
world
language
learning
challenges
|||
unfortunately
|||
formal
english
teaching
in
public
schools
is
not
succeeding
and
it
is
far
out
of
reach
to
the
large
|||
numbers
of
children
who
are
not
able
to
attend
school
regularly
|||
from
the
literature
e
|||
g
|||
and
|||
our
fieldwork
in
the
poorest
state
of
india
two
significant
factors
stand
out
irregular
school
|||
attendance
owing
to
the
need
for
students
to
work
in
fields
homes
etc
|||
and
the
preparation
of
|||
local
teachers
who
themselves
have
very
poor
training
in
english
|||
regional
schools
typically
|||
have
no
english
teacher
rather
a
handful
of
teachers
who
cover
everything
|||
in
our
years
of
|||
fieldwork
we
have
usually
been
unable
to
communicate
with
local
teachers
in
english
and
have
|||
relied
on
interpreters
|||
at
the
same
time
high
technology
in
the
form
of
cellphones
are
being
used
by
indians
at
all
|||
economic
levels
|||
india
is
the
largest
market
for
cellphones
worldwide
and
the
majority
are
now
|||
being
bought
by
illiterate
and
semiliterate
users
|||
and
a
growing
percentage
of
these
phones
|||
feature
advanced
multimedia
capabilities
for
photos
and
gaming
|||
we
argue
that
these
devices
are
|||
a
perfect
vehicle
for
new
kinds
of
informal
outofschool
language
learning
|||
all
these
factors
|||
create
an
extraordinary
opportunity
to
dramatically
expand
english
skills
in
young
indians
|||
which
is
the
fastest
way
to
open
the
doors
for
employment
and
further
education
|||
while
our
|||
paper
abstract
iconference
|||
work
can
be
integrated
with
and
can
complement
the
school
english
curriculum
the
greatest
|||
opportunity
is
in
outofschool
learning
|||
the
indian
children
we
studied
even
those
with
work
|||
commitments
for
the
family
spent
an
hour
or
so
daily
playing
with
friends
and
several
hours
|||
watching
television
|||
we
believe
that
esl
learning
games
on
cellphones
can
address
the
above
challenges
|||
games
|||
have
wellknown
immersive
properties
that
is
the
learner
experiences
themselves
as
being
|||
inside
the
game
|||
games
continually
challenge
players
to
develop
new
skills
and
reward
their
|||
acquisition
|||
players
often
spend
long
hours
in
games
which
allows
them
to
develop
advanced
|||
skills
|||
games
can
be
social
experiences
which
encourage
communication
with
other
players
|||
and
|||
finally
games
can
be
designed
to
mirror
the
realworld
games
that
children
play
providing
them
|||
with
tools
and
encouragement
to
use
english
recreationally
outside
the
electronic
game
|||
leveraging
elearning
games
for
education
in
developing
regions
is
not
farfetched
|||
at
least
two
|||
nongovernment
organizations
pratham
and
the
azim
premji
foundation
have
used
computer
|||
games
in
their
initiatives
for
children
in
the
urban
slums
and
rural
areas
of
india
respectively
|||
most
importantly
a
largescale
evaluation
by
pratham
showed
significant
gains
on
mathematics
|||
test
scores
from
playing
computer
games
that
target
math
learning
|||
it
is
plausible
that
similar
|||
learning
outcomes
can
be
replicated
using
mobile
games
for
esl
|||
in
this
paper
i
introduce
my
dissertation
work
which
is
now
in
its
th
year
|||
it
is
informed
by
six
|||
rounds
of
fieldwork
over
three
years
with
children
living
in
the
urban
slums
and
rural
areas
of
|||
india
|||
our
total
time
actually
in
the
field
is
over
six
months
|||
a
goal
of
these
field
studies
was
to
|||
learn
firsthand
about
the
everyday
learning
contexts
of
the
above
children
as
part
of
a
broader
|||
needs
assessment
|||
another
objective
was
to
examine
the
feasibility
of
our
ideas
for
technologyassisted
learning
by
piloting
offtheshelf
software
and
early
designs
of
our
mobile
applications
|||
on
a
very
small
scale
with
children
from
the
urban
slums
and
villages
|||
building
on
the
systems
|||
requirements
that
we
have
learned
iteratively
from
these
studies
we
are
completing
a
final
round
|||
of
design
and
prototyping
in
fall
in
preparation
for
a
yearlong
deployment
in
|||
rural
children
displaying
you
win
screens
from
two
cellphone
games
that
we
have
designed
|||
success
in
these
|||
games
and
mastery
of
the
technology
was
a
considerable
incentive
and
source
of
pride
for
these
children
|||
these
|||
kinds
of
behaviors
were
repeated
over
and
over
|||
a
longitudinal
randomized
experiment
over
more
than
two
years
with
over
urban
slums
students
|||
paper
abstract
iconference
|||
since
our
previous
findings
are
already
published
i
will
only
review
those
games
that
we
have
|||
designed
so
far
and
their
learning
outcomes
|||
instead
in
this
paper
i
want
to
focus
on
metaissues
|||
related
to
the
projects
design
methodology
and
its
interdisciplinary
nature
|||
in
particular
i
want
|||
to
draw
attention
to
the
challenges
of
doing
information
systems
research
in
this
highly
difficult
|||
domain
and
offer
strategies
based
on
how
i
would
undertake
a
project
in
this
domain
differently
|||
if
i
had
to
do
it
a
second
time
|||
the
rest
of
this
paper
addresses
the
following
issues
|||
what
is
an
effective
model
for
multidisciplinary
collaboration
while
the
most
conventional
|||
approach
is
to
assemble
a
specialist
from
each
domain
to
form
a
team
we
have
learned
that
|||
specialists
in
their
respective
areas
are
not
always
able
to
relate
to
the
unique
problem
that
|||
lies
at
the
intersection
of
these
multiple
areas
of
expertise
|||
i
have
often
found
myself
acting
|||
as
the
interpreter
between
computer
programmers
and
curriculum
developer
in
my
team
|||
more
importantly
i
will
describe
the
theoretical
frameworks
that
i
drew
upon
from
second
|||
language
acquisition
and
game
studies
and
how
my
|||
knowledge
of
both
areas
to
a
certain
degree
in
addition
to
humancentered
design
made
it
|||
possible
for
me
to
perform
the
essential
conceptual
footwork
for
integrating
them
in
our
elearning
game
designs
even
as
i
relied
on
our
curriculum
developer
for
her
practical
|||
experience
in
teaching
english
in
india
|||
how
can
we
develop
competencies
across
disciplinary
boundaries
that
make
interdisciplinary
|||
work
possible
here
i
will
trace
my
intellectual
development
from
my
initial
schooling
in
|||
computer
science
and
humancomputer
interaction
to
my
realization
that
the
problem
i
am
|||
confronting
in
my
dissertation
actually
belongs
to
the
education
domain
and
my
subsequent
|||
socialization
in
the
school
of
education
to
learn
their
trade
|||
what
are
some
appropriate
approaches
for
conducting
crosscultural
research
in
information
|||
systems
while
ethnographic
methods
are
critical
for
understanding
the
practices
and
beliefs
|||
of
a
community
culture
is
a
dynamic
phenomenon
that
changes
quickly
especially
in
the
face
|||
of
rapid
technology
uptake
e
|||
g
|||
cellphones
in
emerging
regions
|||
i
will
cite
my
experiences
|||
from
an
international
development
project
in
africa
involving
handheld
technology
to
argue
|||
that
conducting
feasibility
studies
with
multiple
user
communities
is
necessary
for
revealing
|||
our
cultural
assumptions
|||
in
particular
i
will
support
this
claim
by
describing
the
differences
|||
in
how
children
in
north
and
south
india
play
our
games
differently
|||
what
data
collection
challenges
are
there
with
users
in
developing
regions
who
lack
the
|||
exposure
to
technology
and
literacy
levels
for
them
to
articulate
their
thoughts
meaningfully
|||
so
as
to
be
directly
useful
for
technology
design
we
have
found
that
while
it
is
difficult
to
|||
obtain
useful
data
from
child
users
other
than
by
observing
them
use
the
technology
we
have
|||
obtained
useful
feedback
by
showing
our
designs
to
highly
educated
local
informants
who
|||
know
these
children
well
as
caregivers
or
educators
|||
similarly
the
mundane
obstacles
in
|||
conducting
fieldwork
with
local
communities
with
the
help
of
interpreters
offer
clues
to
|||
ingrained
beliefs
and
deeper
patterns
of
behavior
that
affect
technology
use
|||
i
will
describe
a
|||
few
of
these
behaviors
that
we
have
observed
