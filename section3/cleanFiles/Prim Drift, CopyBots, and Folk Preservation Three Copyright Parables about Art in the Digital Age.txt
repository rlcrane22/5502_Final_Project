i
pay
particular
attention
to
the

of

we

that

has
helped
guarantee
the
survival
of
important
works
of

insist
that
the

is
not

in

the

a

on
cyberinfrastructure
for

the

and

|||
as
used
by
the

the

covers
the
aggregate
social
technological

institutional
legal
economic
and
human
capital
needed
to
advance
the

in

our
cultural
commonwealth
identifies
six
key
challenges
that
must
|||
be
overcome
if
we
are
to
fulfill
the
promise
of
a
robust
|||
cyberinfrastructure
of
which
arguably
the
most
daunting
and
complex
is
|||
copyright
|||
in
its
page
document
the
commission
invokes
|||
intellectual
property
no
less
than
times
ultimately
concluding
that
|||
although
it
can
offer
no
simple
solutions
the
various
|||
stakeholders
named
in
the
report
nonetheless
have
an
obligation
to
do
|||
what
they
can
to
strengthen
and
support
the
public
domain
and
fair
use
|||
provisions
of
the
law
|||
to
decline
this
advocacy
role
is
to
jeopardize
|||
the
precious
few
limitations
on
absolute
copyright
upon
which
we
as
|||
information
professionals
rely
in
our
efforts
to
preserve
and
transmit
|||
the
cultural
record
|||
perhaps
nowhere
is
that
danger
more
ominously
|||
expressed
than
in
susan
bielsteins
permissions
a
survival
guide
|||
blunt
talk
about
art
as
intellectual
property
|||
asking
permission
of
a
rights
holder
zealously
and
unnecessarily
also
|||
catches
you
up
in
a
mentality
of
acquiescence
|||
acquiescence
is
a
|||
wasting
disease
rooted
in
anxiety
and
ignorance
and
it
helps
propel
the
|||
allconsuming
permissions
culture
|||
in
the
quotidian
world
of
|||
intellectual
property
acquiescence
operates
far
beneath
the
beacon
eye
|||
of
statute
or
treaty
and
capitalizing
on
it
is
not
good
for
anyones
|||
health
|||
it
wastes
time
it
wastes
money
and
it
produces
a
compliant
|||
society
vulnerable
to
abuse
and
wholesale
ideological
shifts
in
the
law
|||
the
purpose
of
this
talk
then
is
twofold
first
to
furnish
a
case
|||
file
of
networkdriven
digital
art
that
dramatizes
the
conflict
between
|||
private
and
public
rights
in
creative
culture
i
|||
e
|||
the
provocative
|||
prim
drift
copybots
and
folk
preservation
mentioned
|||
in
my
title
which
are
part
of
a
larger
conversation
about
emergent
art
|||
genres
and
creative
communication
technologies
such
as
d
virtual
|||
worlds
that
although
still
in
their
infancy
will
shortly
become
as
|||
established
in
their
own
way
as
television
and
video
are
today
and
|||
second
to
propose
as
an
experimental
intervention
into
the
legal
|||
system
and
modeled
in
part
after
the

foundation
a
|||
humanities
center
staffed
by
archivists
librarians
visual
resource
|||
curators
art
historians
humanities
researchers
and
lawyers
dedicated
|||
to
testing
in
a
court
of
law
with
the
aim
of
legally
validating
claims
|||
that
in
the
words
of
gary
schwartz
have
the
potential
to
maximize
|||
our
own
collective
position
as
holders
of
copyright
in
public
domain

works
or
i
would
add
as
users
of
copyright
in
private
domain
works
|||
the
choice
of
an
arts
and
humanities
dataset
to
seed
the
discussion
|||
about
copyright
is
inspired
in
part
by
a
venerable
roster
of
artists
who
|||
have
challenged
prevailing
assumptions
about
the
nature
of
creativity
|||
originality
and
authorship
|||
these
assumptions
in
turn
inform
cultural
|||
attitudes
toward
intellectual
property
|||
the
cutups
of
william
s
|||
burroughs
the
readymades
of
marcel
duchamp
the
appropriation
art
of
|||
sherrie
levine
jeff
koons
and
andy
warhol
all
potentially
run
afoul
of
|||
modern
ip
law
|||
for
this
reason
the
arts
frequently
act
as
an
early
|||
warning
system
for
copyright
alerting
us
to
potential
ambiguities
in
|||
the
case
law
or
to
legislative
actions
that
alter
intentionally
or
not
|||
the
delicate
balance
between
the
rights
of
creators
and
the
rights
of
|||
users
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
sought
to
protect
|||
it
is
not
|||
only
artists
themselves
but
also
the
collectors
scholars
publishers
|||
museums
libraries
executors
and
rights
agents
drawn
into
their
orbit
|||
who
have
the
power
to
upset
or
restore
the
golden

which

such
as
cars

books
and
furniture

can
be

into

their

to

the
damage
potential
problems
arise
once
the
|||
items
have
been
sold
|||
this
is
because
every
creative
asset
in
sl
is
|||
encoded
with
a
set
of
permissions
that
dictate
how
it
may
be
distributed
|||
and
used
by
other
residents
|||
the
permissions
system
includes
four
|||
fields
move
modify
copy
and
transfer
|||
if
either
the
second
or
|||
fourth
of
these
is
disabled
the
owner
of
the
object
as
distinct
from
|||
its
creator
is
prevented
from
exercising
freedoms
that
are
normally
|||
either
unregulated
or
protected
by
law
in
real
life
the
right
to
modify
|||
an
object
for
personal
use
and
the
right
to
resell
or
give
away
a
|||
lawfully
obtained
copy
under
the
first
sale
doctrine
figures
and
|||
thus
for
example
in
rl
i
may
annotate
my
copy
of
gone
with
the
|||
wind
in
preparation
for
class
discussion
or
take
it
to
the
bookbinder
|||
for
repair
if
the
pages
come
loose
or
donate
it
to
my
local
public
|||
library
when
i
no
longer
need
or
want
it
without
infringing
on
the
|||
authors
copyrights
|||
by
contrast
if
i
own
a
book
in
sl
i
may
not
be
|||
able
to
do
these
things
i
may
not
be
able
to
repair
the
book
if
it
|||
shows
signs
of
prim
drift
or
give
it
as
a
gift
to
someone
else
|||
the
|||
inability
to
alter
objects
for
personal
use
warrants
further
|||
consideration
as
an
analogy
it
would
be
as
if
i
suddenly
found
myself
|||
in
a
world
where
there
were
no
tailors
to
hem
pants
or
cobblers
to
mend
|||
shoes
or
antique
experts
to
restore
grandmas
heirloom
hutch
|||
the
set
of
problems
im
describing
are
as
applicable
to
the
d
web
as

they
are

complicate
the
transfer
of
software
applications
from
one
party
|||
to
another
suggesting
that
the
erosion
of
the
first
sale
and
fair
use
|||
doctrines
in
second
life
is
part
of
a
much
larger
trend
|||
because
this
example
and
the
other
two
mentioned
in
my
title
function
as
|||
limit
cases
for
copyright
policy
showing
us
where
the
system
breaks
|||
down
in
a
digital
environment
and
allowing
us
to
probe
its
edges
they
|||
help
justify
what
might
otherwise
be
seen
as
an
implausible
proposal
to
|||
establish
a
humanities
center
that
would
expand
the
site
of
activism
to
|||
include
not
only
the
customary
conference
proceedings
working
groups
|||
white
papers
articles
and
symposia
but
also
crucially
the
courts
|||
nearly
a
decade
ago
art
historian
gary
schwartz
urged
his
colleagues
in
|||
a
spirited
talk
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
college
art
association
to
|||
adopt
more
assertive
measures
to
revive
an
ailing
fair
use
doctrine
|||
in
|||
an
attempt
to
persuade
his
audience
members
of
the
need
for
innovative
|||
approaches
schwartz
informed
them
that
he
had
been
assured
by
|||
counsel
that
test
trials
on
any
of
these
copyright
issues
in
a
|||
wellchosen
court
stand
an
excellent
chance
of
success
|||
in
|||
such
a
strategy
might
have
seemed
improbable
in
im
convinced
|||
it
is
not
|||
with
the
establishment
of
a
grant
initiative
in
to
|||
fund
work
in
the
area
of
intellectual
property
and
the
longterm
|||
protection
of
the
public
domain
the
macarthur
foundation
has
|||
signaled
its
readiness
to
support
experimental
programs
recent
|||
recipients
include
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
which
was
awarded
|||
over
half
a
million
dollars
in

is
to

protect
the
public
interest
in

worldhelps
defend
free

speech
privacy
and
consumer
rights
in
part
by
subjecting
them
to
|||
legal
proceedings
in
a
court
of
law
|||
it
thus
serves
as
an
important
|||
precedent
for
the
course
of
action
advocated
here
|||
what
would
distinguish
the
center
i
envision
from
either
the
eff
or
|||
stanfords
center
for
internet
and
society
is
the
role
of
the
|||
humanist
who
would
serve
not
as
an
ancillary
figure
but
one
central
to
|||
the
centers
mission
and
success
|||
although
i
suspect
many
are
capable
|||
of
envisioning
humanities
scholars
as
evangelists
public
relations
|||
spokespeople
legal
assistants
legal
researchers
or
legislative
|||
advocates
in
this
enterprise
i
believe
they
are
qualified
to
do
more
|||
to
serve
as
expert
witnesses
or
consultants
in
civil
cases
involving
|||
intellectual
property
and
the
arts
|||
the
literary
scholar
who
|||
specializes
in
textual
transmission
the
philosopher
who
investigates
|||
theories
of
language
or
the
nature
of
universals
and
the
art
historian
|||
who
publishes
on
reproductive
printmaking
are
all
de
facto
semioticians
|||
experts
in
sign
systems
and
how
they
work
|||
because
intellectual
|||
property
concerns
itself
with
originals
and
copies
a
substantial
body
|||
of
case
law
hinges
on
the
semiotic
distinction
between
the
two
|||
the
|||
ability
to
state
when
two
objects
are
fundamentally
the
same
or
|||
differentto
determine
for
example
if
a
copy
of
salvador
dalis
|||
persistence
of
memory
is
primarily
substitutive
or
transformativeis
|||
therefore
a
legal
desideratum
one
which
many
humanists
are
qualified
to
|||
help
address
|||
given
the
central
and
fundamental
role
of
sign
systems
writes

jeffrey
long
in
a
special
issue
of
semiotica
why
is
the
field
that

to

government
|||
and
we
might
add
the
law
a
preliminary
survey
of
judicial
|||
opinions
on
court
cases
that
involve
accusations
of
copyright
|||
infringement
of
visual
works
of
art
turns
up
a
network
of
seemingly
|||
contradictory
ad
hoc
or
ambiguous
rulings
that
would
benefit
from
the
|||
rigorous
application
of
semiotic
principles
of
individuation
principles
|||
that
would
allow
us
to
make
tighter
discriminations
among
things
like
|||
originals
copies
versions
remixes
editions
and
other
relevant
|||
categories
|||
the
point
here
is
that
semiotics
could
be
instrumental
in
|||
helping
courts
adjudicate
between
the
competing
copyright
claims
of
|||
plaintiffs
and
defendants
as
well
as
in
fortifying
fair
use
and
the

public
domain

contrary
to
the
position
recently
espoused
by

regarding
the
lack
of
any
utilitarian

whatsoever

both

nonetheless
join
the

historical
ranks
of
pirates
who
deserve
recognition
for
archival
and

preservation
achievement
in
the
arts
|||
my
second
example
comes
from
the
world
of
cinema
|||
in
an
online
|||
interview
the
british
screenwriter
peter
briggs
relates
how
he
lost
and
|||
subsequently
found
his
alien
vs
|||
predator
script
|||
i
wrote
a
vs
p
originally
|||
on
an
amstrad
computer
which
was
|||
about
one
step
above
a
univac
room
filler
|||
in
i
swapped
to
an
apple
|||
mac
which
ive
used
ever
since
|||
and
i
ended
up
losing
the
amstrad
disk
|||
which
was
some
weird
unreadable
proprietary
brand
anyway
|||
it
wasnt
|||
until
whoever
it
was
transcribed
it
and
pirated
it
onto
the
web
years
|||
later
that
i
was
able
to
cutandpaste
it
into
final
draft
and
have
an
|||
electronic
copy
again
|||
so
thankyou

wherever
you

by

|||
my
third
example
the
one
on
which
id
like
to
spend
the
most
time
is
|||
agrippa
a
book
of
the
dead
an
artists
book
coauthored
by
the
|||
writer
william
gibson
and
the
artist
dennis
ashbaugh
and
published
by

described
in

gibson
introduction
to
agrippa
|||
agrippa
is
difficult
to
classify
both
physically
and
generically
|||
it
|||
was
originally
sold
in
two
versions
|||
the
deluxe
version
came
wrapped
in
|||
a
shroud
its
cover
artificially
aged
and
its
pages
|||
scorchedtimeburned
like
the
photo
album
described
in
|||
gibsons
poem
agrippa
files
|||
inside
are
etchings
by
ashbaugh
|||
and
double
columns
of
dna
that
ostensibly
encode
the
genome
of
a
|||
fruitfly
kirschenbaum
xi
|||
nestled
in
the
center
of
the
book
is
a
|||
inch
floppy
disk
that
contains
the
poem
a
meditation
on
time
memory
|||
and
decay
|||
its
governing
metaphor
is
that
of
the
mechanism
a
|||
trope
notes
matthew
kirschenbaum
that
manifests
itself
as
a
|||
photograph
album
a
kodak
camera
a
pistol
and
a
traffic
light
as
well
|||
as
in
less
literal
configurations
|||
ix
agrippa
among
other
things
|||
is
about
our
misplaced
faith
in
the
permanence
and
objectivity
of
media
|||
like
human
memories
media
distort
invent
and
erase
the
very
objects
|||
theyre
designed
to
preserve
handwriting
fades
and
becomes
illegible
|||
photographs
break
the
fourth
wall
by
constantly
reminding
us
of
the
|||
world
that
lies
just
outside
the
picture
frame
and
inert
technological
|||
artifacts
put
up
no
resistance
when
new
ones
come
along
to
replace
or
|||
destroy
them
|||
paradoxically
the
speaker
of
the
poem
takes
recourse
in
|||
his
own
recollections
to
supplement
the
incomplete
records
of
the
past
|||
records
that
were
originally
intended
to
compensate
for
the
limitations
|||
of
memory
|||
by
such
a
process
he
tries
to
recapture
for
instance
the
|||
smells
of
the
sawmill
once
owned
by
his
father
whose
tumbled
boards
|||
and
offcuts
are
pictured
in
an
old
photograph
gibson
agrippa
|||
drawing
on
a
synaesthetic
imagination
he
uses
the
visual
stimulus
to
|||
prompt
an
olfactory
memory
|||
this
complex
interplay
between
mechanism
|||
and
memory
structures
the
poem
as
a
whole
and
shapes
its
manifold
|||
meanings
|||
agrippas
core
themes
are
expressed
through
form
as
well
as
content
|||
some
of
ashbaughs
etchings
are
overlaid
with
images
printed
in
|||
uncured
toner
which
are
inevitably
smudged
and
distort
those
beneath
|||
and
facing
them
when
the
pages
are
turned
kirschenbaum
xi
|||
more
|||
stunningly
as
has
been
often
described
gibsons
electronic
poem
is
|||
encrypted
to
scroll
automatically
down
the
screen
once
before
being
|||
irrevocably
lost
its
text
disappearing
after
a
single
reading
|||
agrippa
|||
is
therefore
subjected
like
all
material
objects
to
the
forces
of
|||
decay
but
here
those
forces
are
manufactured
rather
than
natural
|||
causing
the
work
to
disintegrate
at
an
accelerated
rate
|||
ashbaugh
in
|||
particular
took
considerable
delight
in
anticipating
how
this
|||
volatility
would
confound
librarians
archivists
and
conservators
as
|||
gavin
edwards
explains
to
register
the
books
copyright
ashbaugh
|||
would
need
to
send
two
copies
to
the
library
of
congress
|||
to
|||
classify
it
they
|||
would
have
to
read
it
and
to
read
it
they
|||
would
have
to
destroy
it
|||
significantly
however
it
was
not
|||
the
librarians
who
found
a
workaround
to
the
problem
but
the
pirates
|||
on
december
a
group
of
new
york
university

secretly

in

after
transcribing

proliferated

the
hack

as
the

come

is
told
with
the
hardboiled

suspense
of
a

by
matthew

who
uncovered
the

gritty

while

what
is
worth
noting
here
is
that
the

to
some
degree
undercut
by
copyright
laws

whereas
publicly

must
abide
by
these
laws
they
go
unheeded

by
shadow
groups
such
as
the
mindvox
users
who
transmit

at

risk
of

litigation
|||
the
irony
of
course
is
that
despite

omnipresence

it
is
absent
from
the
one

authoritative

to

what
the

underscores
is
the

what
are

analogy
however
facetious
between
a
|||
legitimate
federally
funded
preservation
program
and
a
software
tool
|||
best
known
for
its
ability
to
facilitate
criminal
activity
the
easy
|||
conflation
of
preservation
with
piracy
no
doubt
has
something
to
do
with
|||
the
fact
that
the
simple
act
of
copying
is
central
to
both
|||
one
of
the
|||
most
reliable
ways
to
preserve
an
object
after
all
is
to
duplicate
it
|||
this
idea
is
so
basic
that
it
has
been
codified
as
a
general
principle
|||
lots
of
copies
keep
stuff
safe
lockss
|||
but
an
intellectual
|||
property
system
that
grants
only
minimal
exemptions
to
libraries
|||
museums
and
archives
from
the
prohibition
against
copying
provides
|||
insufficient
grounds
for
putting
this
principle
into
actionunless
|||
that
is
there
are
official
or
unofficial
lines
of
communication
that
|||
exist
between
them
and
a
grey
market
economy
that
plays
by
different
|||
rules
|||
this
indeed
is
the
lesson
of
history
our
creative
heritage
|||
infrastructure
has
not
evolved
independently
of
piratical
practices
but
|||
codependently
with
them
|||
writing
about
early
european
print
culture
|||
for
example
in
his
magisterial
the
nature
of
the
book
adrian
johns
|||
observes
that
in
the
sixteenth
through
the
eighteenth
centuries
|||
pirates
were
|||
not
a
distinguishable
social
group
|||
they
existed
|||
at
all
ranks
of
the
stationers
community
the
guild
responsible
for
|||
enforcing
copyrights
and
at
times
were
among
its
most
prominent
and
|||
upstanding
members
|||
similarly
meredith
mcgill
suggests
that
|||
unauthorized
reprinting
in
nineteenthcentury
antebellum
america
was
so
|||
pervasiveso
fully
embedded
in
everyday
publishing
practicesthat
it
|||
constituted
part
of
the
horizon
of
the
ordinary
|||
we
need
|||
then
to
better
understand
the
systems
of
exchange
that
exist
between
|||
lawful
and
unlawful
preservation
regimes
and
determine
the
extent
to
|||
which
the
former
is
beholden
to
the
latter
|||
and
we
need
to
get
a
better
|||
purchase
on
the
intellectual
property
restrictions
that
apply
directly
|||
or
indirectly
to
the
contact
zone
between
them
|||
for
example
if
a
|||
benefactor
were
to
donate
a
large
collection
of
materials
to
a
library
|||
that
included
pirated
books
or
software
the
firstsale
doctrine
would
|||
presumably
be
rendered
moot
making
parts
of
the
transaction
illegal
|||
giving
credence
to
the
historical
importance
of
the
pirate
as
|||
preservationist
provokes
new
kinds
of
questions
some
answerable
some
|||
probably
not
|||
are
there
authors
whose
works
have
descended
to
us
exclusively
in
|||
pirated
editions
or
unauthorized
copies
or
reprints
if
so
who
are
|||
they
|||
if
we
could
tally
the
total
number
of
books
that
exist
in
the
world
and
|||
divide
them
into
two
groups
one
containing
authorized
copies
the
other
|||
unauthorized
what
would
be
the
ratio
of
one
to
the
other
will
we
ever
|||
have
the
means
to
quantify
piracy
the
difficulty
of
developing
|||
criteria
that
would
allow
us
to
confidently
assign
a
book
to
one
|||
category
or
the
other
would
only
serve
to
underscore
some
of
the
issues
|||
raised
here
|||
is
pursuing
a
kind
of
heroic
preservation
whereby
we
seek
to
transmit
a
|||
cultural
artifact
wholly
intact
and
unchanged
to
posterity
a
fools
|||
errand
does
cultural
piracy
demonstrate
the
truth
of
the
old
adage
|||
that
the
perfect
is
the
enemy
of
the
good
is
the
transformation
of
|||
culture
from
one
generation
to
the
next
something
to
be
valued
rather
|||
than
lamented
can
a
fragment
or
a
shard
serve
as
a
synecdoche
for
a
|||
larger
whole
that
once
existed
|||
my
background
in
textual
scholarship
and
bibliography
tells
me
that
we
|||
would
be
wise
to
lower
the
threshold
of
what
constitutes
successful
|||
preservation
|||
the
distinction
between
a
legitimate
preservation
regime
|||
and
a
piratical
one
is
often
illusory
based
on
the
faulty
assumption
|||
that
the
former
is
the
guarantor
of
stability
while
the
latter
delivers
|||
only
volatility
|||
as
an
antidote
to
such
notions
id
like
to
close
|||
with
an
account
of
textual
transmission
found
in
the
british
playwright
|||
tom
stoppards
the
invention
of
love
|||
stoppards
play
tells
the

story
of
the
early
twentiethcentury
poet
and
classicist
a

e

housman
|||
who
having
just
died
reminisces
about
his
life
while
being
ferried
|||
across
the
river
styx
by
the
boatman
charon
in
the
underworld
|||
in
this
|||
passage
an
oxford
don
narrates
the
reception
history
of
the
latin
poet
|||
catullus
whose
textual
fate
is
shared
in
its
broad
strokes
by
countless

other
writers
of
antiquity
|||
here
then
is
a
tale
of
preservation
|||
blemishes
and
all
|||
anyone
with
a
secretary
knows
that
what
catullus
really
wrote
was

already
corrupt
by
the
time
it
was
copied
twice
which
was
about
the
|||
time
of
the
first
roman
invasion
of
britain
and
the
earliest
copy
that

has
come
down
to
us
was
written
about
years
after
