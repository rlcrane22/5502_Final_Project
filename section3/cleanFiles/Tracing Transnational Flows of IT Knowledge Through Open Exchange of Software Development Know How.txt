information
technology
it
is
often
promoted
as
a
socially
and
|||
culturally
agnostic
tool
that
will
allow
emerging
economies
to
|||
leap
into
the
digital
age
and
reap
the
wealth
that
accompanies
it
|||
but
in
addition
to
the
programming
language
software
tools
and
|||
books
knowhow
is
needed
to
turn
bright
ideas
into
innovative
|||
marketable
solutions
|||
this
knowhow
can
only
be
acquired
from
|||
experience
or
from
other
it
developers
|||
an
effective
means
for
|||
sharing
knowhow
is
through
an
open
exchange
which
we
|||
characterize
as
a
space
where
interested
people
can
learn
critique
|||
and
contest
ideas
|||
its
a
locale
that
is
defined
in
terms
of
activity
|||
rather
than
geography
technology
or
membership
|||
we
use
open
|||
exchanges
of
knowhow
as
an
analytical
lens
to
example
|||
historical
examples
and
contemporary
instances
|||
while
|||
conducting
fieldwork
in
india
we
observed
open

occurring
at
barcamp
bangalore
|||
it
is
through
these
exchanges
of

knowhow
rather
than
the
transmission
of

or

that
it

flows
between
international

we
conclude
this

it
is

touted
as
the
route
to

national

and
the

of
the
global

while

there
are
many
good
reasons
to
accept
this

analyzing
this
process
a
technologically
and
b
sociohistorically
|||
a
more
nuanced
formulation
of
this
claim
is
likely
to
|||
have
beneficial
effects
on
various
kinds
of
policymaking
that
|||
base
themselves
on
versions
of
this
claim
|||
first
we
wish
to
disaggregate
the
notion
of
knowledge
itself
and
|||
specifically
it
knowledge
into
two
components
knowwhat
|||
and
knowhow
|||
no
doubt
it
could
be
further
subdivided
but
at
|||
a
first
level
of
approximation
this
heuristic
division
reminds
us
|||
that
technology
itself
is
both
a
knowledgesystem
and
a
practice
|||
it
is
both
a
highly
systematized
explicitly
formulated
and
|||
repeatedly
tested
set
of
logically
nested
truths
which
allows
us
to
|||
know
what
laws
hold
and
a
highly
fluid
set
of
practices
intuitive
|||
beliefs
and
implicit
codes
which
allow
us
to
know
how
to
do
|||
things
|||
there
has
been
much
historical
and
sociological
work
on
|||
expertise
and
knowwhat
forms
of
it
knowledge
but
less
on
|||
the
intuitive
socially
coded
set
of
practices
we
wish
to
lump
|||
under
the
heading
of
knowhow
|||
we
suggest
that
understanding
|||
knowhow
will
help
us
better
understand
some
of
the
ways
in
|||
which
groups
of
software
developers
share
knowledge
|||
software
development
innovates
and
it
knowledge
travels
|||
along
transnational
circuits
of
practitioners
|||
thus
the
policy
areas
that
are
elucidated
include
questions
such
|||
as
where
should
we
look
for
the
next
wave
of
ideas
in
software
|||
development
to
fuel
the
nations
economy
we
suggest
in
closing
|||
that
many
sites
of
oftenoverlooked
creativity
and
innovation
may
|||
exist
in
marginal
networks
outside
the
mainstream
areas
of
|||
software
development
|||
below
we
briefly
explain
what
we
mean
by
knowhow
|||
we
then
|||
explore
why
a
more
complex
ethnographic
understanding
of
|||
knowhow
might
elucidate
the
ways
in
which
software
innovation
|||
occurs
and
how
this
shifts
our
models
of
global
dispersion
of
|||
technological
practices
|||
finally
we
explore
the
policy
|||
implications
|||
what
is
technological
knowhow
|||
in
their
classic
work
the
social
shaping
of
technology
donald
|||
mackenzie
and
judy
wajcman
suggest
that
technology
has
|||
three
layers
of
meaning
physical
objects
the
human
activities
|||
associated
with
these
objects
and
most
importantly
knowledge
|||
about
how
to
conceive
design
build
and
repair
these
objects
a
|||
rather
fuzzy
area
they
term
knowhow
|||
this
latter
area
know
|||
how
is
fuzzy
and
not
merely
to
post
hoc
analysis
|||
more
|||
intriguingly
expert
technological
practitioners
often
cannot
put
|||
into
words
how
they
know
what
to
do
when
confronted
with
a
|||
technological
challenge
|||
other
theorists
have
suggested
that
|||
knowhow
cannot
be
captured
in
words
and
is
often
visual
and
|||
tactile
not
just
mathematical
or
verbal
pp
|||
historians
of
technology
have
suggested
that
this
sort
of
implicit
|||
practical
skill
at
the
nexus
of
art
and
craft
is
in
fact
the
older
|||
meaning
of
technology
itself
and
have
explored
the
variations
of
|||
meaning
in
la
technologie
french
technology
la
technique
|||
french
technique
and
die
technik
german
technics
in
|||
lewis
mumfords
translation
|||
and
contains
completed
solutions
but
not
the
knowhow
needed
|||
to
build
new
solutions
|||
the
constraints
of
the
problem
the
|||
problem
context
and
the
decisions
made
as
part
of
the
design
|||
process
are
missing
|||
many
technologies
are
complex
but
software
|||
especially
so
and
this
complexity
is
often
compounded
by
its
size
|||
an
application
like
microsoft
excel
can
contain
upwards
of
ten
|||
million
lines
of
source
code
|||
it
can
be
very
difficult
to
locate
the
|||
knowhow
in
this
tangled
mass
of
classes
interfaces
design
|||
patterns
delocalized
plans
and
scattered
concerns
|||
as
well
it
can
|||
be
difficult
to
modify
since
the
omission
of
a
single
file
or
even
|||
an
error
in
a
single
line
of
code
can
cause
a
program
to
fail
to
|||
compile
into
an
executable
that
will
run
correctly
|||
a
set
of
issues
is
raised
for
us
by
this
sts
approach
to
technology
|||
and
the
practical
arts
|||
first
how
does
knowhow
function
in
|||
software
development
second
what
can
we
learn
from
other
|||
historical
examples
and
finally
how
does
this
function
in
a
|||
global
not
just
national
context
|||
open
source
software
artifacts
are
necessary
but
not
sufficient
to
|||
transmit
knowhow
|||
software
development
knowhow
needs
to
be
|||
acquired
through
experience
or
from
other
practitioners
|||
every
|||
successful
open
source
project
has
a
corresponding
community
|||
that
interacts
through
forums
or
mailing
lists
and
sometimes
|||
through
embodied
meetings
|||
we
have
found
that
open
exchanges
|||
are
critical
to
the
exchange
and
transmission
of
software
|||
development
knowhow
|||
the
role
of
knowhow
in
software
|||
development
|||
knowhow
has
an
important
role
in
software
development
and
its
|||
acquisition
is
necessary
to
attain
proficiency
in
the
craft
|||
whereas
|||
knowwhat
is
explicit
factual
knowledge
knowhow
is
the
ability
|||
to
put
knowwhat
into
practice
|||
knowhow
is
necessary
to
|||
successfully
innovate
|||
programming
languages
application
|||
frameworks
and
software
tools
are
generalpurpose
technologies
|||
they
are
intentionally
designed
to
be
highly
flexible
and
|||
adaptable
and
the
onus
is
on
the
developer
to
use
these
tools
to
|||
create
specific
solutions
|||
furthermore
this
knowhow
needs
to
be
|||
constantly
updated
because
software
technology
and
the
|||
information
ecologies
of
endusers
are
constantly
changing
|||
knowhow
is
the
link
between
creativity
and
innovation
|||
creativity
can
be
described
as
the
generation
of
ideas
while
|||
innovation
is
the
practical
application
of
those
ideas
into
workable
|||
solutions
|||
knowhow
is
the
procedural
and
experiential
|||
knowledge
that
is
needed
to
perform
the
transformation
|||
successfully
|||
in
information
technology
knowhow
takes
many
|||
forms
such
as
working
knowledge
of
application
program
|||
interfaces
apis
and
libraries
the
craft
skills
for
creating
a
|||
database
schema
and
the
judgment
to
know
when
to
apply
|||
different
principles
|||
this
it
knowhow
is
highly
situated
which
|||
means
that
it
needs
to
be
adapted
to
specific
situations
and
|||
constantly
emerging
because
the
problems
and
technologies
are
|||
constantly
changing
|||
therefore
open
exchanges
where
people
can
|||
seek
out
provide
and
share
it
knowhow
are
particularly
|||
important
in
this
domain
for
sustaining
innovation
|||
open
source
software
|||
the
most
commonly
cited
space
of
open
exchange
is
the
domain
|||
of
open
source
developers
who
work
through
communities
based
|||
on
exchanging
and
increasing
knowhow
|||
open
source
software
|||
is
often
cited
as
means
for
leveling
inequalities
between
|||
intellectual
and
material
haves
and
havenots
|||
although
open
|||
source
developers
have
forged
ingenious
modes
of
sharing
|||
knowledge
it
is
in
fact
surprisingly
difficult
to
share
knowhow
|||
through
software
artifacts
|||
this
difficulty
is
due
to
properties
of
source
code
|||
program
|||
source
is
too
complex
to
be
understood
on
its
own
or
even
with
|||
typical
documentation
too
brittle
to
travel
well
between
settings
|||
open
exchanges
for
software
|||
development
knowhow
|||
an
open
exchange
is
a
space
where
interested
people
can
learn
|||
critique
and
contest
ideas
|||
it
is
not
so
much
a
physical
or
virtual
|||
place
or
even
a
particular
event
but
rather
an
opening
for
a
|||
particular
kind
of
interaction
|||
in
this
sense
the
classical
greek
|||
agora
as
a
marketplace
of
ideas
a
crossroads
for
intersecting
|||
contingencies
and
a
forum
for
a
critical
public
community
was
|||
also
an
open
exchange
|||
its
a
locale
that
is
defined
in
terms
of
|||
activity
rather
than
geography
technology
or
membership
|||
another
formulation
of
an
open
exchange
in
terms
of
activities
is
|||
link
lurk
and
try
meaning
linking
with
others
of
like
minds
|||
lurking
on
the
periphery
of
a
community
of
practice
and
trying
|||
out
new
things
with
low
risk
|||
examples
of
trying
are
|||
accessing
and
using
new
technologies
airing
new
ideas
and
|||
rehearsing
arguments
|||
any
site
that
has
the
capability
for
a
community
of
individuals
to
|||
interact
with
each
other
directly
has
the
potential
to
become
an
|||
open
exchange
|||
they
are
not
necessarily
geographic
locations
or
|||
regular
events
they
can
be
virtual
spaces
and
informal
meetings
|||
their
memberships
can
be
restricted
and
controlled
or
they
can
|||
be
informal
and
unregulated
|||
the
exchanges
can
be
public
or
they
|||
can
be
within
an
organization
|||
what
distinguishes
a
merely
social
|||
group
from
an
exchange
is
common
practice
that
is
the
|||
organization
of
the
community
around
a
set
of
problems
|||
technologies
or
knowhow
|||
the
adjective
open
applies
to
the
|||
sharing
of
ideas
and
solutions
unfettered
by
hierarchical
|||
structural
constraints
reporting
relationships
and
professional
|||
rank
|||
the
most
effective
open
exchanges
appear
to
be
ones
with
a
|||
diverse
membership
with
people
representing
a
broad
spectrum
|||
of
local
contingencies
and
social
groups
|||
john
seely
brown
has
|||
argued
that
it
is
the
trust
and
creative
abrasion
in
such
|||
communities
that
is
the
key
to
innovation
|||
innovation

argues
convincingly
cannot
be
managed
but
instead
must
be

critically
nurtured
by
creating
a
space
for
pluralismneither

stifling
it
nor
letting
it
run
amuck
|||
the
open
source
movement
has
resulted
in
a
worldwide
|||
community
of
practice
and
a
network
of
open
exchanges
|||
communities
of
practice
are
a
highly
effective
means
for
learning

knowhow

in
domains
involving

thrilling
examples

one
of
the

main
organizers
of
bcb
expressed
his
commitment
to

exchanges
of

as
the
primary
reason
for
his
devotion
to

the

to
the

community
many
of
them
spoke
of
their
involvement
in

|||
many
bcb
participants
reported

searching
for
open
exchange
forums
not
primarily
from

ideological
opposition
to
proprietary
software
or
social

commitments
to

but
simply
because
they
found
they

there

many
historical

preachers

adventurers
carried

around
the

and
shaping
networked

while
some
analyses
have
characterized
these

as
traveling
between
cores
and

the
story
is
a
more

complicated
one
than
the
standard
one
about
conquest

domination
submission
and
tribute

rather
transnational
circuits

of

and
culture
became
the
conduits
for

open

are
central

open

around

barcamps
are

semiofficial
ways
in
which
software
developers
learn
from
|||
and
forge
communities
of
practice
|||
barcamps
all
over
india
have
been
vital
in
projects
such
as
|||
localization
of
software
popularizing
new
programming
|||
languages
and
techniques
among
nonnative
english
speakers
and
|||
the
discussion
of
the
social
and
political
context
of
emerging
it
|||
economies
|||
one
of
us
philip
attended
barcamp
bangalore
|||
bcb
in
august
to
learn
about
open
exchanges
in
this
|||
context
|||
barcamps
are
full
of
a
palpable
excitement
|||
participants
give
up
|||
weekend
leisure
after
grueling
workweek
schedules
in
corporate
|||
programming
jobs
in
order
to
meet
with
people
they
come
to
|||
consider
their
most
intimate
community
yet
whom
they
largely
|||
know
only
online
|||
the
combination
of
virtual
and
physical
|||
worlds
technical
and
social
discussions
work
and
leisure
and
|||
the
emergence
of
open
exchanges
such
as
bcb
serve
to
underline
|||
our
critique
that
the
transmission
of
software
artifacts
through
the
|||
open
source
movement
is
not
sufficient
to
transmit
knowhow
|||
as
well
social
networking
practices
and
technologies
are
not
|||
sufficient
to
create
the
communities
of
practice
that
are
necessary
|||
to
locate
and
share
knowhow
|||
rather
it
is
the
configuration
of
|||
the
elements
into
open
exchanges
that
is
necessary
to
create
an
|||
autonomous
cadre
of
software
developers
that
is
needed
to
|||
develop
the
software
needed
by
local
contexts
|||
in
this
manner
it
|||
knowledge
flows
across
national
boundaries
to
bring
information
|||
works
and
countries
into
a
global
context
|||
historical
lessons
revisited
|||
is
todays
open
source
revolution
another
manifestation
of
the
|||
parameters
that
have
historically
governed
technological
|||
progress
|||
our
preliminary
investigations
suggest
that
although
the
current
|||
period
of
it
innovation
shows
many
novel
aspects
there
are
|||
strong
historical
resemblances
which
are
worth
investigating
|||
further
|||
for
example
historian
pamela
longs
study
of
technical
|||
arts
and
the
culture
of
knowledge
from
antiquity
to
the
|||
renaissance
finds
that
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenthcentury
technological
practitioners
commonly
advocated
|||
openness
freely
disseminating
their
knowledge
of
subjects
such
|||
as
mining
ore
processing
artillery
and
fortification
|||
other
|||
historians
of
science
have
shown
that
early
modern
scientific
|||
communities
were
rooted
in
moral
economies
formed
by
webs
|||
of
values
about
collaboration
selfdiscipline
and
sharing
|||
these
values
were
initially
drawn
from
the
ambient
culture
such
|||
as
the
model
of
the
humble
dedicated
and
selfdisciplined
saint
|||
which
influenced
seventeenth
century
models
of
the
natural
|||
philosopher
and
remained
intrinsic
to
eighteenth
century
|||
scientific
personalityideals
|||
these
values
however
morphed
|||
over
time
into
specific
scientific
values
without
direct
|||
correspondences
to
the
broader
culture
|||
scientific
cultures
reworked
and
recirculated
a
dynamic
web
of
|||
values
to
form
moral
economies
particular
to
each
scientific
|||
community
|||
the
resulting
scientific
moral
economy
could
not
|||
be
explained
simply
as
a
reflection
of
cultural
norms
|||
more
recent
|||
ethnographic
studies
of
hacker
communities
suggests
that
their
|||
technological
practice
is
closely
tied
to
their
cultural
values
|||
regarding
freedom
individuality
sharing
and
innovation
|||
for
|||
example
ethnographer
gabriella
coleman
suggests
that
the
form
|||
and
content
of
open
source
software
embodies
structures
of
|||
linkage
transparency
and
connectivity
that
are
dynamically
|||
related
with
similar
values
in
the
open
source
community
|||
since
open
source
communities
are
globally
dispersed
and
|||
function
without
conventional
facetoface
interaction
there
are
|||
few
social
mechanisms
to
enforce
structures
of
exchange
|||
rather
|||
than
cultural
or
organizational
conventions
it
is
technology
that
|||
functions
as
the
medium
of
exchange
embodying
values
of
|||
openness
|||
the
mutual
embeddedness
of
open
cultures
of
exchange
and
|||
technologies
of
open
design
is
only
just
beginning
to
be
|||
understood
|||
we
suggest
that
the
combination
of
historical
|||
ethnographic
and
software
engineering
methodologies
provides
a
|||
promising
route
to
a
robust
understanding
of
this
important
|||
dynamic
which
is
a
part
of
the
most
innovative
new
software
|||
design
practices
today
|||
techniques
and
practices
of
sharing
are
some
of
the
most
creative
|||
and
the
most
controversial
technological
developments
of
the
last
|||
decade
|||
it
is
the
shared
excitement
about
technological
challenges
|||
that
facilitates
and
motivates
new
kinds
of
remote
|||
communication
|||
it
is
the
speed
and
global
scope
of
the
internet
|||
that
allows
young
geeks
to
build
global
shared
communities
|||
and
any
perceived
threat
to
widespread
access
fuels
much
of
their
|||
activism
|||
why
do
software
sharing
communities
or
what
we
call
knowhow
|||
agoras
spend
so
much
time
and
energy
developing
technologies
|||
and
practices
of
sharing
many
open
source
developers
have
|||
dayjobs
in
proprietary
software
companies
but
spend
their
|||
personal
unpaid
hours
coding
and
debugging
software
that
|||
belongs
to
nobody
yet
is
potentially
anybodys
|||
a
shared
|||
excitement
about
dispersed
problem
solving
as
well
as
a
|||
commitment
to
open
exchange
of
it
knowledge
fuels
open
|||
source
communities
|||
compartmentalization
into
departments
and
|||
companies
appears
to
be
wasteful
in
terns
of
optimizing
|||
creativity
because
knowledge
is
siloed
meaning
there
is
a
|||
narrow
division
of
labor
|||
developers
spend
a
lot
too
much
of
|||
their
time
locating
resources
and
not
enough
time
playing
with
|||
the
resources
|||
theorists
across
disciplines
including
legal
|||
anthropologist
rosemary
coombe
ethnographer
of
|||
globalization
arjun
appadurai
and
scholarentrepreneur
|||
john
seely
brown
have
pointed
out
that
information
has
a
|||
cultural
and
social
life
that
is
it
is
produced
shaped
exchanged
|||
and
designed
in
fundamentally
social
contexts
not
just
in
|||
individual
minds
|||
sharing
is
a
key
necessity
for
this
|||
transformation
in
the
patterns
of
design
innovation
and
the
|||
emergence
of
open
exchange
systems
for
software
knowhow
is
a
|||
key
to
creativity
in
it
|||
discussion
and
implications
|||
histories
of
science
and
technology
teach
us
how
to
look
for
webs
|||
of
values
particular
to
extremely
innovative
technical
|||
communities
|||
these
histories
also
indicate
why
an
|||
interdisciplinary
method
is
necessary
while
historians
of
culture
|||
and
ethnographers
might
be
alert
to
forms
of
communication
|||
patterns
of
collaboration
and
innovative
organizational
behavior
|||
software
engineers
and
handson
programmers
are
needed
to
|||
identify
forms
of
creativity
that
are
tied
to
the
techniques
of
|||
writing
code
designing
system
architectures
and
ensuring
|||
interoperability
|||
multiple
methodological
skills
must
be
combined
|||
to
discover
what
connections
exist
between
technical
creativity
|||
and
cultural
practices
|||
consider
the
question
of
where
should
we
look
for
the
next
wave
|||
of
ideas
in
software
development
to
fuel
the
nations
economy
|||
we
have
suggested
that
creativity
and
innovation
exists
in
|||
marginal
networks
outside
the
mainstream
areas
of
software
|||
development
|||
corporations
are
rarely
the
source
of
radical
new
ideas
novel
|||
ideas
typically
come
from
cottage
industries
and
grass
roots
|||
organizations
|||
a
few
examples
from
the
internet
era
are
blogging
|||
digital
music
sharing
and
open
source
software
|||
these
are
|||
practices
that
originated
at
the
margins
of
society
but
have
|||
become
mainstream
and
subsequently
adopted
by
corporations
|||
venture
capitalists
have
long
understood
that
the
next
big
thing
|||
can
come
from
unlikely
corners
so
they
are
willing
to
take
big
|||
risks
on
unknown
upstarts
because
the
payoffs
can
be
huge
|||
this
|||
observation
is
consistent
with
two
decades
of
scholarship
in
the
|||
history
of
technology
which
suggests
not
only
that
knowledge
|||
often
flows
from
margins
to
center
but
also
that
the
very
|||
definition
of
central
or
universal
knowledge
is
one
that
|||
continuously
incorporates
margins
and
gives
rise
to
new
|||
peripheries
|||
a
continuous
dynamic
emerges
intellectual
and
|||
popular
mainstream
and
marginal
core
and
periphery
interact
|||
and
shape
each
other
in
a
historical
spiral
whose
parameters
are
|||
simultaneously
social
political
and
technical
|||
therefore
our
|||
hypothesis
suggests
that
more
work
is
needed
in
the
|||
understanding
of
subcultures
at
the
margins
economic
social
|||
and
geographic
|||
we
should
move
to
investigating
margins
as
not
|||
simply
lacking
in
the
resources
of
the
center
but
rather
as
|||
potential

radical
