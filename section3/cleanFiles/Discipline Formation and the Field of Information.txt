abstract
|||
the
field
of
information
as
expressed
in
the
ischool
caucus
is
in
many
|||
respects
a
conglomeration
of
disparate
elements
|||
it
includes
for
|||
example
elements
of
several
major
traditions
of
information
|||
organization
commonly
expressed
as
service
professions
and
the
social
|||
institutional
ties
and
contexts
that
some
of
them
entail
|||
in
addition
|||
the
field
has
also
gathered
under
its
umbrella
an
impressive
array
of
|||
such
other
elements
as
aspects
of
cognitive
studies
social
studies
of
|||
the
users
and
use
of
information
studies
and
services
related
to
the
|||
internet
and
world
wide
web
digital
libraries
and
other
systems
that
|||
have
no
particular
social
institutional
setting

not

among
which
are
growing
museum
and
digital

security
social
issues
of

information
property
and
rights
and
the
entire
array
of
informatics
|||
initiatives
to
name
only
some
of
the
whole
|||
within
this
enlarged
|||
context
one
issue
of
significance
is
the
role
of
discipline
formation
|||
where
the
latter
refers
to
efforts
to
identify
a
fundamental
phenomenon
|||
related
to
larger
core
professional
activities
and
explain
aspects
of
|||
that
phenomenon
through
scientific
methodology
and
objectivity
|||
the
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
use
two
examples
of
discipline
formation
|||
within
traditions
of
information
organization
bibliography
and
|||
computerized
information
storage
and
retrieval
as
a
basis
for
enriching
|||
and
provoking
our
contemporary
understanding
of
discipline
formation
|||
within
the
field
of
information
|||
as
such

fourth

intellectual

geographies
in
which
attendees
can
learn
about
intellectual
domains
not
|||
their
own
but
part
of
the
multidisciplinary
ischool
space
|||
background
|||
a
tradition
consists
of
a
cluster
of
activities
objects
and
ideas
that
|||
are
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
in
human
society
|||
each
|||
such
tradition
gains
adherents
and
subsequently
evolves
and
shifts
|||
through
endogenous
and
exogenous
factors
|||
a
tradition
of
information

organization
has
to
do
more
specifically
with
activities
and
ideas
|||
related
to
organizing
information
objects
and
the
information
embedded
|||
in
such
objects
|||
traditions
of
information
organization
go
beyond

practical
techniques

for
example
they
include
ideas
related
to
values

that
are
attributed
by
their
adherents
to
information
objects
as
objects

and
the
information
they
contain
and
to
the
roles
and
uses
of
such

objects
and
their
informational
content
in
society
|||
all
major
traditions
|||
of
information
organization
in
the
modern
period
have
had
their
|||
beginnings
in
the
form
of
what
today
would
be
called
service
|||
professions

two

eraprovide
a
basis
for
raising
questions
about
|||
discipline
formation
within
the
field
of
information
|||
salient
features
|||
include
the
fact
that
each
took
as
its
beginning
point
the
|||
identification
representation
and
itembyitem
listing
of
documents
|||
deemed
of
value
for
their
subject
content
|||
each
initially
took
on
|||
professional
service
ideals
related
to
the
crisis
of
providing
access
to
|||
burgeoning
publications
especially
in
the
realm
of
scholarly
and
|||
scientific
research
|||
despite
such
service
profession
orientations
and
|||
unlike
other
traditions
of
information
organization
each
has
been
|||
relatively
free
from
the
constraints
of
a
specific
social
institutional
|||
setting
|||
each
went
through
periods
of
attempting
to
describe
and
clarify
|||
what
amounted
to
uncertain
boundaries
and
oftenchanging
content
|||
each
|||
developed
commercial
expressions
of
its
work
though
in
the
case
of
|||
bibliography
commercial
expressions
came
to
be
expressed
chiefly
in
the
|||
form
of
two
traditions
of
information
organizationindexing
and
|||
documentationfor
which
it
was
the
principal
seedbed
|||
most
significantly
each
of
these
traditions
gave
rise
to
discipline
|||
formation
within
its
boundariesbibliography
in
the
form
of
analytical
|||
or
critical
bibliography
cisar
in
the
form
of
bibliometrics
and
|||
computational
information
retrieval
|||
each
effort
in
discipline
formation
|||
had
both
positive
and
negative
effects
|||
positive
effects
consisted
of
|||
the
satisfaction
gained
by
its
adherents
of
being
able
to
state
more
|||
precisely
what
their
realm
of
scholarly
endeavor
entailed
an
increase
|||
in
scholarly
status
within
the
general
academic
community
and
attendant
|||
increases
in
public
acceptance
and
funding
that
an
improved
status
|||
generated
|||
negative
effects
included
various
expressions
of
alienation
|||
of
the
adherents
in
the
parent
tradition
when
those
forming
a
|||
disciplinary
focus
in
this
way
attempted
to
distance
themselves
from
the
|||
parent
tradition
and
the
effect
of
criticisms
of
the
scientific
base
of
|||
the
new
discipline
that
were
generated
because
of
the
conflict
involved
|||
why
this
matters
|||
discipline
formation
within
the
field
of
information
seems
inevitable
or
|||
at
least
highly
probable
if
not
already
well
underway
given
the
status
|||
that
disciplinary
work
generates
in
the
modern
world
|||
and
given
that
|||
inevitability
or
high
probability
it
seems
appropriate
to
try
to
apply
|||
at
least
some
of
what
occurred
in
the
two
instances
described
here
to
|||
the
current
information
field
situation
|||
however
taking
such
notice
of
|||
such
past
developments
and
applying
the
latter
to
the
present
situation
|||
can
best
be
done
not
in
the
form
of
predictions
which
are
all
but
|||
impossible
but
by
attempting
to
pose
useful
questions
based
on
or
at
|||
least
provoked
by
relevant
issues
in
the
past
|||
a
list
of
more
general
topics
around
which
such
questions
might
revolve
|||
include
the
existence
of
professional
service
ideals
and
their
|||
relationship
to
the
idea
of
an
academic
discipline
focus
the
problem
of
|||
defining
boundaries
and
content
of
the
field
as
a
whole
or
of
some
|||
elements
of
the
field
e
|||
g
|||
an
information
organization
tradition
|||
within
the
field
and
the
role
of
commercial
parameters
of
the
field
|||
topics
more
specific
to
discipline
formation
itself
might
include
the
|||
importance
of
identifying
a
fundamental
phenomenon
to
which
rigorous
|||
scientific
methods
and
explanation
may
be
applied
how
differing
|||
phenomena
might
yield
different
discipline
formation
efforts
and
how
|||
they
might
coexist
and
both
positive
and
negative
effects
of
|||
discipline
formation
for
the
field
as
a
whole
|||
more
specific
questions
|||
might
for
example
take
the
form
of
can
information
service
|||
profession
needs
coexist
with
discipline
formation
within
the
|||
information
field
and
if
so
how
what
are
the
costs
of
severing
|||
ties
for
various
reasons
with
parent
traditions
of
information
|||
organization
and
their
social
institutional
settings
what
might
be
|||
expected
in
the
way
of
idea
interplay
regarding
the
scientific
basis
and
|||
objectivity
of
a
discipline
within
the
larger
information
arena
what
|||
might
be
the
stance
of
the
information
field
in
general
towards
|||
discipline
formation
that
downplays
scientific
methodologies
and
|||
explanations
suggestions
will
be
made
about
how
to
think
about
answers
|||
to
questions
such
as
these
though
the
purpose
of
raising
them
as
well
|||
as
reciting
the
comparison
provided
here
that
lies
behind
them
and
that
|||
prompted
them
is
to
provoke
discussions
as
to
what
questions
regarding
|||
discipline
formation
within
the
information
field
are
the
most
|||
important
