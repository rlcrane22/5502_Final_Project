abstract
|||
the
success
of
escience
research
depends
not
only
upon
effective
|||
collaboration
between
scientists
and
technologists
but
also
upon
|||
the
active
involvement
of
information
scientists
|||
archivists
rarely
|||
receive
scientific
data
until
findings
are
published
by
which
time
|||
important
information
about
their
origins
context
and
|||
provenance
may
be
lost
|||
research
reported
here
addresses
the
|||
lifecycles
of
data
from
ecological
research
with
embedded
|||
networked
sensing
technologies
|||
a
better
understanding
of
these
|||
processes
will
enable
information
scientists
to
participate
in
|||
earlier
stages
of
the
life
cycle
and
to
improve
curation
of
these

types
of

introduction
|||
the

depends
upon
effective

|||
partners
often

must
learn
how
to
produce
data
that
are
meaningful
to
participants

from
multiple
disciplines
|||
many
decisions
are
made
about
data
at
|||
each
stage
in
its
life
cycle
|||
curation
of
these
data
and
their
value
|||
for
reuse
depends
heavily
on
how
much
is
known
about
their
|||
origins
derivation
and
provenance
|||
archivists
typically
receive
scientific
data
only
after
the
findings
|||
of
a
study
are
published
or
after
a
researcher
retires

neither
of

these
archival
outcomes
provides
access
to
scientific

in
a

our

research

has
been
part
of

since
its
inception
|||
while
few
scientific
data
were
generated
in
the
|||
early
years
we
were
planting
the
seeds
of
archival
practice
and

preservation
|||
once
data
captured
by
cens
instrumentation
|||
became
relevant
to
our
application
scientists
we
took
a
more
|||
active
role
in
building
the
necessary
infrastructure
for
longterm

access
|||
our
initial
research
focused
on
defining
what
were

in

an
example
of
a

embedded
networked

system
|||
deployment
will
provide
context
for
the
life
cycle
of
cens
data
|||
cens
researchers
utilize
several
deployment
models
|||
along
with
|||
static
deployments
typical
of
observatories
such
as
neon
or
|||
geon
cens
researchers
regularly
go
on
shortterm
|||
deployments
or
campaigns
where
sensing
systems
are
|||
deployed
in
the
field
for
a
few
days
|||
among
the
benefits
of
this
|||
approach
for
exploratory
research
are
compatibility
with
the
data
|||
collection
practices
of
application
science
researchers
most
are
in
|||
biology
or
environmental
sciences
the
ability
to
field
test
|||
delicate
and
expensive
experimental
equipment
and
the
|||
opportunity
for
science
and
engineering
researchers
to
work
|||
together
in
the
field
to
troubleshoot
technical
problems
and
|||
improve
the
overall
quality
of
data
|||
an
example
of
a
cens
deployment
is
the
study
of
biological
|||
processes
associated
with
harmful
algal
blooms
|||
in
designing
a
|||
deployment
the
application
science
researchers
biologists
in
this
|||
example
identify
a
viable
research
site
in
this
case
a
lake
known
|||
for
summer
blooms
|||
available
background
information
about
the
|||
lake
includes
peak
months
for
algae
a
topology
of
the
lakebed
|||
local
species
of
phyto
and
zooplankton
and
nutrient
presence
and
|||
concentration
|||
the
engineering
researchers
determine
which
|||
equipment
are
most
appropriate
for
capturing
the
data
desired
by
|||
the
scientists
|||
prior
to
going
in
the
field
the
team
calibrates
equipment
in
the
|||
laboratory
based
on
knowledge
of
the
types
of
organisms
likely
to
|||
be
present
in
the
water
|||
because
of
the
natural
variation
of
water
|||
organisms
calibrations
will
be
augmented
with
physical
water
|||
samples
taken
adjacent
to
sensors
|||
a
wet
lab
will
be
set
up
on
|||
site
to
process
water
samples
|||
once
on
site
the
team
deploys
|||
sensors
in
the
lake
using
static
buoys
that
house
a
power
source
|||
data
logger
and
wireless
communication
system
|||
they
document
|||
gps
coordinates
of
each
buoy
times
of
placement
and
serial
|||
numbers
of
each
sensor
in
a
laboratory
notebook
|||
the
data
collection
process
is
a
combination
of
preplanned
|||
activities
and
infield
decisions
|||
because
the
aquatic
phenomena
|||
of
interest
vary
on
diel
or
hour
cycle
scientists
take
data
for
a
|||
full
hours
|||
once
sensors
begin
to
report
data
researchers
begin
|||
observing
interesting
phenomena
such
as
that
the
water
flows
|||
more
quickly
at
one
end
of
the
lake
and
that
the
water
is
greener
|||
and
at
a
higher
temperature
where
a
rock
slows
the
flow
|||
based
on
|||
such
information
the
team
may
change
the
data
collection
|||
strategy
altering
plans
for
sensor
placement
or
for
hand
collection
|||
of
water
samples
|||
at
the
end
of
a
deployment
equipment
is
|||
removed
and
returned
to
the
lab
|||
water
samples
are
processed
for
|||
organism
identification
and
concentration
and
for
nutrient

sensor
data
are
compared
to
the
inlab
and
infield

and
to
other
trusted

only
then
are

be
grouped

the

most
serve
multiple
purposes
for

instance
the
scientific
data
collected
can
be
used
to
identify
sensor

faults
|||
when
we
asked
our
subjects
about
capturing
using
sharing
and
|||
preserving
data
from
deployments
and
about
capabilities
they
|||
desired
in
archives
to
support
their
data
the
primary
interest
was
|||
in
the
scientific
data
|||
computer
science
and
engineering
|||
researchers
were
as
concerned
about
the
quality
and
accessibility
|||
of
scientific
data
as
were
the
domain
scientists
|||
conversely
the
|||
computer
science
and
engineering
researchers
took
little
interest
|||
in
maintaining
access
to
sensor
performance
data
or
|||
proprioceptive
data
that
are
essential
to
their
own

|||
these

forms
of

appear
to
serve
transient
purposes
for
these

researchers
with

however
they
may
be

us

to

to

on
some
of

the

in
teasing
out
the
variation

present
in
two
of
the
phases
of
the
lifecycle
the
generalization

broke

there
was
a
clear
distinction
between
what
happened
to
the

data
created
as
a
part
of
technology
research
and
those
data
|||
created
when
science
and
technology
researchers
worked
together
|||
and
these
were
both
different
from
the
data
created
by
scientific
|||
research
|||
these
three
types
of
lifecycle
are
characterized
by
what

the

is
meant
to
accomplish
be
that

technological

or
development

this
latter
is
when
both
science
and

researchers

collect
data
in
the
field
with
the
technologists
responsible
for
the

in

the

these

tasks
that
are
performed
iteratively

is

|||
technology
research
has
the
luxury
of
not
always
needing
to
go
|||
out
into
the
field
|||
much
of
their
research
involves
testing
models
|||
or
algorithms
generating
data
from
these
and
evaluating
the
|||
performance
none
of
which
requires
fieldwork
|||
at
the
same
time
|||
the
data
generated
in
the
lab
may
be
wildly
different
from
those
|||
captured
in
the
field
and
the
occasional
reality
check
is
necessary
|||
to
maintain
a
clear
heading
|||
when
the
technologists
perform
|||
fieldwork
they
do
not
need
the
scientists
present
to
capture
data
|||
that
will
progress
their
research
because
their
test
subject
in
these
|||
cases
are
the
equipment
and
systems
themselves
|||
similarly
the
|||
scientists
do
not
need
to
bring
the
technologists
along
for
their
|||
own
data
collection
efforts
unless
they
want
to
use
the
sensing
|||
equipment
|||
many
technology
research
cycles
happen
between

deployments
just
as
many
infield
technology
deployments
|||
happen
between
a
sciencetechnology
development
deployment
|||
for
scientists
on
the
other
hand
the
frequency
of
data
collection
|||
cycle
is
much
lower
with
most
cycles
lasting
a
year
or
more
|||
these
science
research
cycles
carry
a
much
higher
investment
for
|||
the
data
collected
|||
the
interplay
of
the
cycles
are
negotiated
based
|||
on
time
available
and
need
|||
coordinating
larger
deployments
to
|||
collect
data
that
is
meaningful
to
both
the
scientists
and
the
|||
technologists
is
a
significant
investment
of
time
and
resources
|||
difficult
as
they
are
these
are
the
rare
opportunities
to
see
the
|||
users
using
the
instruments
and
the
systems
allowing
the
|||
technologists
to
begin
the
next
iteration
of
the
design
|||
comparing
these
three
data
lifecycles
reveals
the
affects
of
|||
collaboration
on
routine
research
by
either
the
science
or
|||
technology
researchers
|||
the
experiment
design
phase
is
much
|||
different
during
the
collaborative
cycle
attempting
to
offer
|||
significant
research
opportunities
to
both
parties
|||
the
data
capture
|||
phases
are
very
different
for
each
cycle
during
the
science
|||
research
cycle
the
emphasis
is
on
hand
collected
samples
the
|||
collaborative
cycle
is
concerned
more
with
the
capture
of
sensor
|||
data
than
the
hand
sample
data
even
though
this
data
is
significant
|||
to
the
science
researchers
and
acts
as
a
ground
truth
mechanism
|||
for
the
sensor
data
and
the
technology
research
cycles
range
from
|||
collecting
sensor
data
to
generating
data
from
a
model
|||
the
|||
cleaning
integration
and
derivation
phase
is
similarly
different
|||
across
all
three
cycles
but
in
this
case
the
significant
part
is
the
|||
way
the
custody
of
the
data
is
no
longer
shared
|||
the
technology
|||
researchers
must
first
make
sense
of
the
captured
data
in
reference
|||
to
the
technology
and
then
the
science
researchers
will
make
sense
|||
of
them
in
reference
to
the
science
|||
the
final
phase
to
display
|||
divergence
is
the
publication
phase
where
collaboration
forces
|||
both
the
scientists
and
the
technologists
to
publish
in
one
|||
anothers
domains
|||
these
publications
do
not
carry
the
same
|||
weight
as
those
within
their
own
domain
thus
disincentivising
|||
collaboration
|||
these
affects
caused
by
collaboration
appear
to
be
trouble
spots
|||
where
the
future
value
of
the
data
is
compromised
due
to
|||
variations
in
methods
and
processes
across
collaborating
|||
disciplines
|||
for
instance
the
use
of
linear
regression
for
data
|||
analysis
does
not
scale
to
the
volume
of
sensorcaptured
data
thus
|||
scientists
must
rely
on
technologists
for
new
methods
of
|||
interpreting
their
data
|||
linear
regression
is
the
established
method
|||
for
ecological
data
analysis
and
has
been
so
for
multiple
decades
|||
the
science
researchers
in
this
case
are
really
dependent
on
the
|||
tools
being
built
for
them
to
be
as
trustworthy
as
linear
regression
|||
and
stand
up
to
peerreview
|||
another
example
of
this
is
the
|||
variation
in
what
is
considered
data
by
each
group
for
instance
|||
the
technology
researchers
will
consider
their
algorithm
or
the
|||
script
developed
to
be
data
whereas
the
scientists
will
consider
|||
the
hand
sample
or
the
sensor
readings
to
be
data
|||
this
may
opens
|||
gaps
where
one
party
is
not
as
invested
in
the
overall
quality
of
a
|||
specific
data
type
because
it
is
not
central
to
their
own
discipline
|||
actions
taken
at
each
stage
of
the
life
cycle
influence
how
the
|||
resulting
data
can
be
interpreted
hence
it
is
important
that
these
|||
stages
be
documented
and
associated
with
the
resulting
dataset
|||
there
is
a
cumulative
effect
of
decisions
made
at
each
stage
of
the
|||
life
cycle
|||
for
example
decisions
made
in
the
experimental
|||
design
stage
determine
what
data
exist
for
analysis
or
calibration
|||
decisions
are
essential
to
interpreting
the
data
|||
there
is
a
delicate
|||
balance
of
decision
making
between
scientific
and
technology
|||
research
partners
|||
conclusions
future
research
|||
the
success
of
escience
depends
upon
successful
collaboration
|||
between
application
scientists
and
their
partners
in
computer
|||
science
and
engineering
|||
data
resulting
from
such
collaborations
|||
is
expected
to
be
extremely
valuable
for
reuse
by
others
|||
however
the
value
of
data
for
reuse
depends
upon
the
quality
of
|||
those
data
which
in
turn
depends
on
the
ability
to
interpret
the
|||
origins
provenance
and
context
of
the
data
|||
surprisingly
little
is
|||
known
about
how
data
arises
from
escience
collaborations
|||
our
|||
case
study
of
ecological
research
in
the
center
for
embedded
|||
networked
sensing
sheds
light
on
the
various
life
cycles
of
|||
escience
data
|||
our
future
research
will
continue
to
explore
and
refine
the
data
|||
life
cycle
identified
here
and
to
build
systems
to
support
it
|||
in
|||
order
to
determine
how
generalizable
this
threecycle
model
is
|||
across
the
various
research
groups
we
need
to
test
this
model
in
|||
the
field
|||
additionally
we
would
like
to
understand
the
role
of
|||
publication
in
collaboration
specifically
if
the
willingness
to
coauthor
is
skewed
towards
either
the
science
or
technology
|||
researchers
by
exploring
whether
scientists
are
more
apt
to
|||
publish
in
technology
papers
or
the
reverse
|||
given
our
access
to
|||
the
coauthorship
data
from
this
population
answering
this
|||
question
is
a
logical
next
step
|||
we
are
also
curious
about
the
role
|||
of
decisions
made
in
the
field
on
the
calibration
and
capture
|||
interplay
as
well
as
the
experiment
and
design
interplay
|||
at
|||
present
much
of
the
sensing
technology
is
experimental
but
|||
commercial

sensors
also
are

|||
research
|||
questions
about
data
provenance
will
evolve
as
the
technology
|||
stabilizes
and
the
scientific
research
questions
broaden
|||
implications
for
ischool
|||
our
interest
in
understanding
information
from
every
angle
should
|||
lead
us
to
studying
the
processes
and
methods
that
lead
to
the
|||
creation
of
data
|||
scientific
data
represents
the
entire
evidentiary
|||
basis
for
scientific
information
and
knowledge
|||
thus
without
|||
studying
the
life
cycle
of
data
we
are
ignoring
the
premise
of
|||
scientific
information
|||
research
such
as
this
cuts
to
the
heart
of

the
disciplinary
tributaries
that
comprise
