it
addresses
this
theme
through
report
of
an
indepth
case
study
of
the
organizational
social
and
intellectual
evolution
of
one
early
pioneer
in
the
ischool
movement
the
rutgers
university
school
of
communication
information
and
library
studies
scils
the
paper
first
situates
scils
within
the
ischool
movement
examining
its
commonalities
with
and
uniqueness
from
other
members
of
the
ischool
caucus
thereafter
the
paper
focuses
specifically
on
the
evolution
of
doctoral
research
and
training
beginning
with
the
programs
development
as
a
disciplinary
lis
program
followed
by
its
transformation
into
an
interdisciplinary
program
with
the
multidisciplinary
merger
that
founded
scils
in
the
paper
examines
the
evolution
of
ideas
developed
in
dissertation
research
produced
before
and
after
the
founding
of
scils
interdisciplinary
doctoral
program
in
this
includes
analysis
of
the
dissertation
produced
in
the
program
from
to
it
compares
and
contrasts
these
periods
in
terms
of
ideas
methods
and
the
influence
played
by
dissertation
supervisors
in
all
finally
it
examines
the
influence
of
key
organizational
changes
on
the
perceived
identity
of
the
school
its
relationship
with
external
constituencies
and
its
intellectual
vision
into
the
future
of
the
nineteen
academic
units
who
are
members
of
the
ischool
caucus
see
table
scils
is
one
of
seventeen
to
include
information
in
its
name
one
of
thirteen
to
be
identified
as
a
school
within
its
university
one
of
five
to
include
studies
in
its
name
and
one
of
four
to
include
library
in
its
name
it
is
the
only
member
school
with
three
disciplines
included
in
its
name
and
also
the
only
member
school
within
the
ischool
caucus
to
include
communication
in
its
name
the
history
of
scils
doctoral
program
dates
to
the
founding
of
the
graduate
school
of
library
service
gsls
in
with
its
first
doctorates
granted
in
see
table
in
the
gsls
changed
its
name
to
the
graduate
school
of
library
and
information
studies
gslis
the
schools
renaming
occurred
during
a
time
rife
with
uncertainty
during
which
phd
granting
library
programs
throughout
the
country
faced
serious
institutional
scrutiny
and
threat
of
closure
the
move
to
delete
service
and
replace
it
with
studies
promoted
an
image
of
research
rather
than
advanced
professional
training
as
the
emphasis
of
its
doctoral
program
with
the
adding
of
information
to
the
schools
name
acknowledgment
of
the
every
increasing
relevance
of
information
and
technology
for
library
education
and
research
within
five
years
of
its
renaming
the
school
was
radically
transformed
through
merger
demoted
to
departmental
status
the
gslis
faculty
and
masters
program
joined
scils
along
with
the
faculty
and
large
undergraduate
programs
of
the
department
of
communication
and
the
department
of
journalism
and
mass
communication
the
gslis
doctoral
program
continued
in
operation
until
at
which
time
a
new
interdisciplinary
curriculum
and
new
program
name
were
adopted
the
interdisciplinary
program
established
in
has
gone
through
significant
changes
in
the
years
since
most
significant
has
been
the
programs
reorganization
from
a
five
to
a
three
area
of
specialization
model
in
this
change
occurred
shortly
after
two
of
the
schools
three
departments
modified
their
departmental
names
having
removed
service
in
favor
of
studies
in
prior
to
the
merger
with
scils
lis
now
removed
studies
replacing
it
with
science
the
change
of
name
to
the
department
of
library
and
information
science
acknowledged
the
departments
increasing
intellectual
ties
with
and
hires
of
computer
science
and
engineering
faculty
at
this
same
time
with
lis
moving
closer
to
the
physical
sciences
journalism
shifted
its
future
toward
the
humanities
and
away
from
the
social
sciences
symbolically
expressed
through
the
erasure
of
mass
communication
from
its
departmental
in
favor
of
media
studies
although
communication
did
not
pursue
a
change
of
name
for
its
department
it
greatly
focused
its
curriculum
research
and
hiring
around
three
areas
social
interaction
organizational
communication
and
mediated
communication
focusing
especially
on
the
development
of
strength
in
health
communication
linked
to
these
areas
the
proposal
and
adoption
of
a
new
three
area
model
for
the
phd
program
further
supported
a
rising
sense
of
departmental
autonomy
in
pursuit
of
research
and
the
training
of
doctoral
students
the
new
model
aligned
each
of
the
schools
three
departments
with
one
area
within
the
program
communication
processes
library
and
information
science
and
media
studies
in
the
years
since
the
adoption
of
the
three
area
model
has
scils
doctoral
program
has
been
remarkable
productive
in
its
inclusion
of
new
faculty
supervisors
and
in
the
number
of
dissertations
completed
annual
and
yet
despite
its
productivity
old
tensions
have
emerged
those
tensions
reveal
the
conundrums
faced
by
a
multidisciplinary
school
whose
disciplinary
pulls
and
alternative
interdisciplinary
partnerships
have
begun
to
offer
more
attraction
and
reward
than
another
round
of
collective
sense
making
to
secure
the
commons
of
an
identity
