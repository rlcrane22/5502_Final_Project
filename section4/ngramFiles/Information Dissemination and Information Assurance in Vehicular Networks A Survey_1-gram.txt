introduction
over
the
last
four
years
interest
in
vehicular
networks
has
become
resurgent
this
is
primarily
due
to
the
allocation
of
mhz
of
licensed
spectrum
by
the
federal
communications
commission
in
the
ghz
range
for
socalled
dedicated
short
range
communications
dsrc
for
intelligent
transportation
system
applications
this
spectrum
opened
up
new
opportunities
for
realizing
a
variety
of
communications
between
vehicles
both
vehicletovehicle
communications
vv
and
vehicle
to
roadside
infrastructure
vi
beyond
what
the
previously
allocated
unlicensed
spectrum
in
the
mhz
range
could
offer
such
vehicular
networks
aimed
toward
providing
roadside
services
such
as
traffic

and
in

the
efficiency
and
safety
on
the
road
are
emerging
in
both
the
united
states
and
europe
the
large
bandwidth
that
is
available
also
makes
it
feasible
to
envisage
other
applications
such
as
downloading
and
sharing
content
between
vehicles
the
association
of
computing

has
organized
four
annual

since
a
special

of
the

that
have
been
discussed

finally
section
provides
some
discussion
of
open
topics
and
concludes
the
paper
roadside
infrastructure
may
be
connected
to
the
infrastructure
for
extremely
small
durations
of
time
because
of
small
coverage
and
high
vehicular
speeds
so
the
amount
of
information
that
can
be
pulled
from
the
infrastructure
is
necessarily
limited
it
is
also
possible
that
vehicles
move
into
the
range
of
the
roadside
infrastructure
with
some
information
obtained
from
cooperating
vehicles
they
have
encountered
the
issue
then
becomes
one
of
updating
the
information
enhancing
the
reliability
or
relevance
of
information
or
obtaining
information
that
complements
that
already
available
to
the
vehicle
background
organizations
and
standards
in
this
section
we
present
some
background
on
the
architecture
of
vehicular
networks
it
is
assumed
in
much
of
the
literature
that
position
information
is
locally
available
to
each
vehicle
with
an
error
that
is
smaller
than
that
needed
for
safety
applications
a
variety
of
standards
organizations
and
consortiums
are
actively
involved
in
developing
and
promoting
the
technology
for
vehicular
networks
network
architecture
in
vehicular
networks
it
is
expected
that
there
will
be
limited
access
to
an
infrastructure
network
that
will
be
supported
by
roadside
base
stations
such
access
is
limited
in
its
nature
for
two
reasons
first
the
deployment
of
the
infrastructure
is
expected
to
be
slow
and
incremental
leading
to
wide
areas
where
there
is
no
access
to
the
infrastructure
second
a
complete
deployment
is
expected
to
be
sparse
because
of
cost
the
coverage
provide
by
a
roadside
base
station
may
be
on
the
order
of
m
while
roadside
base
stations
may
be
placed
every
km
or
so
consequently
not
all
vehicles
will
be
connected
to
the
infrastructure
at
all
times
to
obtain
access
to
safety
or
other
types
of
information
it
becomes
necessary
to
rely
on
vehicletovehicle
communications
the
ieee
is
involved
in
standards
related
to
the
physical
medium
access
and
security
issues
as
well
as
in
defining
higher
layer
services
and
interfaces
for
intelligent
transportation
by
the
end
of
the
ieee
p
standards
for
wireless
access
in
vehicular
environments
wave
had
specified
the
application
layer
and
message
formats
for
operation
in
the
ghz
dsrc
communications
the
ieee
p
standard
which
is
a
modification
of
the
popular
ieee
wifi
standard
looks
at
issues
related
to
the
highly
dynamic
environment
and
the
extremely
short
time
durations
where
communications
must
be
completed
due
to
the
high
speed
of
the
communicating
vehicles
several
consortiums
with
industry
andor
public
participation
are
also
working
on
furthering
the
development
and
deployment
of
vehicular
networks
some
examples
are
mentioned
here
the
carcar
consortium
comprising
of
automobile
manufacturers
some
universities
and
the
fraunhofer
institute
has
as
one
of
its
primary
objectives
the
creation
and
establishment
of
an
open
and
interoperable
standard
for
vv
communications
in
europe
using
wifi
like
components
some
communication
protocols
are
being
developed
by
the
networkonwheels
now
group
which
is
associated
with
the
carcar
consortium
ford
and
general
motors
created
a
crash
avoidance
metrics
partnership
camp
and
with
the
national
highway
transportation
safety
administration
this
partnership
is
working
on
projects
such
as
enhanced
digital
maps
for
safety
driver
workload
metrics
and
forward
crash

requirements
information

figure

architecture
as
shown
in
figure
vehicles
a
b
and
c
have
access
to
a
roadside
infrastructure
which
has
limited
coverage
these
vehicles
can
obtain
information
from
the
roadside
base
station
however
vehicles
d
e
and
f
have
no
communications
with
the
fixed
infrastructure
for
instance
vehicle
f
will
have
to
rely
upon
information
from
vehicle
e
which
in
turn
has
obtained
information
that
has
passed
through
vehicles
a
and
d
note
that
this
scenario
immediately
creates
issues
that
are
not
necessarily
important
in
other
kinds
of
networks
in
terms
of
how
to
disseminate
information
and
how
to
assure
the
security
of
information
note
also
that
vehicles
that
are
in
the
range
of
a
information
dissemination
using
dsrc
is
quite
attractive
due
to
the
large
bandwidth
and
the
possibility
of
using
multiple
channels
the
ieee
standards
propose
employing
multiple
mhz
channels
each
capable
of
carrying
mbps
of
data
for
vehicular
communications
up
to
seven
channels
are
available
in
the
ghz
bands
and
one
channel
is
supposed
to
be
dedicated
for
safety
applications
the
remaining
channels
could
potentially
be
used
for
content
distribution
and
delivery
in
this
section
we
describe
the
different
types
of
information
that
need
to
be
disseminated
in
a
vehicular
network
and
the
methodologies
that
have
been
considered
in
the
research
literature
types
of
information
it
is
expected
that
the
large
bandwidth
of
dsrc
will
enable
a
variety
of
yet
to
be
anticipated
applications
for
vehicular
networks
such
as
internet
extension
office
on
wheels
pp
file
sharing
etc
the
different
types
of
information
that
need
to
be
communicated
and
shared
in
a
vehicular
network
can
be
classified
into
four
categories
a
safety
information
b
traffic
information
c
infotainment
and
other
service
information
and
d
content
as
discussed
previously
information
may
be
obtained
partly
from
the
roadside
infrastructure
and
partly
from
other
vehicles
that
are
encountered
by
a
given
vehicle
in
the
case
of
many
of
the
above
types
of
information
the
importance
and
relevance
of
the
information
changes
with
space
and
time
for
example
congestion
information
that
is
very
far
away
may
become
increasingly
important
and
need
a
more
recent
update
as
a
vehicle
gets
closer
to
a
congested
area
along
with
updates
on
alternative
paths
that
may
themselves
have
increased
congestion
by
that
point
of
time
safety
information
safety
information
is
the
most
important
of
the
information
types
that
are
communicated
in
a
vehicular
network
in
alone
more
than
people
were
killed
in
motor
vehicle
crashes
in
the
united
states
in
fact
the
primary
purpose
of
dsrc
is
to
greatly
improve
the
safety
of
vehicular
traffic
for
example
dsrc
can
be
used
to
prevent
collisions
between
vehicles
by
providing
information
to
the
driver
about
whether
the
vehicle
ahead
is
braking
if
the
speed
is
too
high
or
the
distance
to
other
vehicles
or
objects
is
getting
too
close
eight
safety
applications
based
on
deliberations
between
government
agencies
and
private
industry
have
been
identified
in
which
are
traffic
signal
violation
warnings
curve
speed
warnings
emergency
electronic
brake
lights
precrash
warnings
cooperative
forward
collision
warnings
leftturn
assistance
lane
change
warning
and
stopsign
movement
assistance
each
of
these
applications
makes
use
of
high
level
data
elements
such
as
acceleration
in
various
quantization
levels
obstacle
direction
wheel
angle
vehicle
width
etc
see
for
more
details
latency
associated
with
many
of
these
safety
messages
is
crucial
the
time
taken
by
the
driver
of
a
motor
vehicle
to
react
to
warnings
has
to
be
considered
while
delivering
information
to
himher
introducing
the
human
component
into
the
picture
the
density
and
environment
in
which
a
vehicle
is
operating
also
influence
the
delivery
of
safety
messages
traffic
information
this
class
of
information
primarily
accounts
for
congestion
on
current
roads
suggestions
for
alternative
paths
to
the
destination
road
construction
information
etc
that
are
useful
for
safety
and
efficiency
but
less
timecritical
than
the
life
safety
messages
discussed
earlier
however
traffic
information
may
still
have
a
higher
priority
than
infotainment
or
content
infotainment
and
services
dsrc
can
also
be
the
mechanism
for
obtaining
infotainment
and
location
based
services
e
g
where
is
the
nearest
coffee
shop
or
buying
a
ticket
to
a
movie
en
route
to
the
theater
using
digital
cash
for
paying
tolls
and
so
on
this
could
also
include
information
such
as
available
parking
spaces
in
the
vicinity
content
recent
research
work
in
vehicular
networks
have
focused
on
content
distribution
and
what
differentiates
content
from
infotainment
and
services
is
the
quantity
o
information
in
most
of
the
research
literature
cited
above
the
assumption
is
that
vehicles
will
be
interested
in
obtaining
extremely
large
files
e
g
video
on
demand
that
cannot
be
obtained
through
a
few
limited
transactions
with
either
the
roadside
infrastructure
or
a
couple
of
nearby
vehicles
the
efficient
discovery
and
distribution
of
large
quantities
of
information
is
a
challenging
problem
especially
in
a
dynamic
environment
information
dissemination
methods
dissemination
of
the
various
types
of
information
poses
numerous
challenges
in
vehicular
networks
because
of
many
reasons
the
size
of
the
network
the
speed
of
vehicles
the
patchy
and
intermittent
connectivity
with
both
the
roadside
base
stations
where
they
exist
and
between
vehicles
as
they
move
the
significance
and
germaneness
of
the
information
that
changes
with
vehicular
position
and
time
are
only
a
few
of
these
reasons
safety
information
has
critical
latency
requirements
content
needs
to
be
efficiently
discovered
and
shared
in
what
follows
we
look
at
the
attempts
in
the
research
literature
to
address
several
open
problems
that
remain
with
respect
to
information
dissemination
in
vehicular
networks
in
order
to
evaluate
the
methods
for
disseminating
information
models
that
capture
the
idiosyncrasies
of
vehicular
networks
are
necessary
however
such
models
are
not
widely
available
in
a
large
scale
simulator
of
vehicular
networks
has
been
developed
and
utilized
for
freeway
scenarios
simulation
models
for
urban
settings
that
include
street
layout
traffic
rules
like
stop
signs
multilane
roads
the
slowing
down
and
speeding
up
of
vehicles
and
attenuation
of
communication
signals
with
distance
are
captured
in
the
importance
of
such
models
cannot
be
emphasized
efficient
and
reliable
dissemination
of
information
will
be
impacted
by
how
vehicles
are
clustered
when
they
form
and
leave
groups
how
far
apart
they
are
under
different
traffic
conditions
the
density
of
vehicles
etc
realistic
vehicular
traces
were
used
with
simulations
in
and
the
authors
demonstrated
that
such
real
traces
show
noticeable
differences
compared
to
widely
used
mobility
models
for
instance
vehicles
merge
into
groups
ahead
of
them
when
they
are
faster
and
break
away
or
split
from
groups
if
they
are
slower
for
example
if
al
vehicles
are
moving
to
the
right
in
figure
vehicle
f
could
eventually
split
from
vehicles
d
and
e
if
it
moves
faster
handling
such
mergers
and
splits
can
impact
packet
delivery
and
thus
information
dissemination
in
the
spatial
propagation
of
information
is
analytically
investigated
and
shown
to
depend
on
vehicle
density
speed
etc
methods
of
delivering
information
vary
in
the
research
literature
information
may
be
opportunistically
pulled
from
other
vehicles
or
the
infrastructure
as
a
target
vehicle
encounters
them
in
an
different
scenario
a
vehicle
carries
information
with
it
and
delivers
it
either
to
the
infrastructure
or
to
other
vehicles
when
it
encounters
them
using
mobility
in
addition
to
wireless
transmissions
to
disseminate
information
this
process
is
called
vehicleassisted
delivery
for
content
delivery
vehicles
can
download
partial
units
of
some
content
and
share
them
afterwards
to
obtain
the
complete
content
this
has
been
called
cooperative
downloading
in
the
case
of
safety
information
and
certain
types
of
traffic
and
service
information
e
g
availability
of
parking
space
the
temporal
and
spatial
delivery
of
information
have
to
be
carefully
considered
for
instance
it
becomes
necessary
to
evaluate
how
far
the
information
should
be
disseminated
and
this
depends
on
the
traffic
conditions
e
g
information
need
be
propagated
over
shorter
distances
in
the
case
of
a
traffic
jam
in
simulations
of
forward
collision
warning
in
a
freeway
scenario
were
conducted
under
the
assumption
that
every
vehicle
periodically
reports
its
information
the
density
of
vehicles
and
their
distance
from
the
target
vehicle
determined
the
success
of
delivery
of
packets
at
the
target
vehicle
one
suggestion
by
the
authors
there
is
to
thus
reduce
the
transmission
range
of
vehicles
to
improve
packet
success
probability
in
the
case
of
traffic
and
service
information
aging
of
the
information
with
time
and
distance
is
suggested
in
information
is
opportunistically
pulled
from
neighboring
vehicles
as
a
target
vehicle
moves
in
a
given
area
such
information
needs
to
have
a
time
stamp
and
a
location
stamp
as
the
vehicle
moves
farther
away
from
where
the
information
is
relevant
or
as
time
elapses
the
information
is
aged
and
eventually
purged
this
enables
vehicles
to
maintain
uptodate
information
without
taxing
memory
and
other
resources
the
propagation
and
survival
of
information
is
discussed
in
and
both
in
time
and
space
because
of
the
spatiotemporal
relevance
of
information
a
piece
of
information
tended
not
to
propagate
beyond
a
specific
boundary
in
time
a
given
piece
of
information
would
propagate
very
quickly
till
it
reaches
a
maximum
number
of
copies
and
then
it
would
also
rapidly
decline
from
that
point
recent
papers
have
addressed
content
distribution
in
vehicular
networks
the
primary
idea
here
is
that
vehicles
download
pieces
of
files
when
they
have
access
to
the
roadside
and
then
share
such
pieces
with
one
another
eventually
they
all
have
the
required
file
the
sporadic
nature
of
connectivity
makes
this
problem
difficult
in
and
content
is
partially
downloaded
from
a
roadside
base
station
which
also
provides
a
list
of
other
vehicles
that
have
parts
of
the
file
each
vehicle
then
gossips
about
what
part
of
the
content
it
has
preference
is
given
to
local
neighbors
to
download
remaining
parts
of
the
file
a
closestrarest
strategy
is
adopted
where
the
rarest
piece
of
the
file
is
downloaded
first
this
approach
resembles
bittorrent
but
is
decentralized
and
employs
proximity
information
to
improve
performance
this
is
because
multihop
communications
degrade
the
performance
of
information
delivery
rapidly
as
the
number
of
hops
increase
in
network
coding
and
mobility
assistance
as
in
along
with
gossiping
as
in
is
employed
with
only
single
hop
distribution
of
content
to
further
improve
performance
a
single
hop
content
distribution
is
also
proposed
in
broadcasting
replicas
of
pieces
of
files
at
the
intersections
of
roads
so
as
to
reach
a
large
number
of
vehicles
is
suggested
in
data
aggregation
as
previously
mentioned
flooding
the
network
with
information
reduces
the
performance
in
terms
of
latency
packet
loss
and
reliability
also
the
relevance
of
information
decreases
with
space
and
time
recently
data
aggregation
schemes
have
been
proposed
to
reduce
the
load
on
the
network
yet
make
useful
information
available
to
vehicles
that
may
be
far
away
in
vehicles
first
produce
a
primary
data
record
that
is
made
up
of
the
vehicles
location
speed
time
stamp
etc
clusters
of
vehicles
create
a
local
view
and
local
views
are
periodically
aggregated
into
cluster
records
aggregate
information
is
disseminated
in
the
network
in
the
difficulty
of
comparing
aggregate
information
in
vehicular
networks
is
discussed
the
problem
here
is
how
a
vehicle
should
decide
which
aggregate
is
better
to
use
since
different
aggregates
may
have
included
different
individual
changed
observations
this
problem
is
addressed
by
using
an
approximate
representation
of
data
in
the
form
of
a
modified
flajoletmartin
sketch
that
enables
aggregation
of
two
aggregated
data
sets
thereby
eliminating
the
problem
of
comparison
information
assurance
assuring
information
in
vehicular
networks
has
unique
challenges
due
to
some
of
the
same
reasons
as
information
dissemination
namely
the
size
of
the
network
the
speed
the
dynamic
topology
the
intermittent
connectivity
lack
of
trust
between
vehicles
etc
the
differing
requirements
of
the
different
types
of
information
in
vehicular
networks
further
complicate
information
assurance
e
g
latency
is
an
important
issue
for
lifesafety
information
while
it
is
not
crucial
for
content
delivery
only
recently
has
some
attention
been
placed
on
the
security
of
vehicular
networks
a
discussion
of
the
vulnerabilities
and
challenges
for
securing
vehicular
communications
is
presented
in
considering
the
usual
information
assurance
services
i
e
confidentialityprivacy
authentication
integrity
availability
and
nonrepudiation
it
is
easy
to
see
how
vehicular
networks
are
vulnerable
since
the
location
information
of
vehicles
is
disseminated
there
is
a
serious
question
of
location
privacy
authenticating
messages
and
ensuring
their
integrity
become
very
important
to
make
certain
that
fabricated
messages
do
not
cause
dangers
to
safety
in
the
worst
case
or
cause
traffic
jams
in
the
best
case
a
vehicle
must
not
deny
being
the
cause
of
an
accident
if
it
indeed
was
responsible
for
it
nor
should
the
blame
be
placed
on
another
vehicle
simple
techniques
like
jamming
of
signals
can
severely
impact
the
safety
of
the
vehicular
network
by
affecting
the
availability
of
information
distribution
of
content
in
vehicular
networks
raises
its
information
assurance
challenges
that
have
hardly
been
considered
in
the
research
literature
in
a
security
architecture
is
presented
that
provides
information
assurance
using
tamperproof
security
hardware
and
a
vehicular
publickey
infrastructure
to
provide
information
assurance
privacy
is
enabled
using
anonymous
keys
preloaded
into
the
tamperproof
hardware
but
which
can
be
tracked
back
to
an
electronic
license
plate
if
law
enforcement
needs
it
in
the
use
of
multiple
credentials
to
decouple
the
identity
of
the
vehicle
from
its
keys
to
potential
eavesdroppers
is
proposed
this
scheme
thus
maintains
privacy
of
the
vehicle
public
key
algorithms
and
protocols
are
however
bandwidth
intensive
making
use
of
certificates
and
may
adversely
affect
latency
requirements
of
safety
information
symmetric
encryption
creates
its
own
set
of
problems
because
of
the
necessity
of
a
trusted
roadside
infrastructure
to
distribute
and
manage
keys
to
solve
this
problem
an
identity
based
security
framework
for
vehicular
networks
is
proposed
in
this
makes
use
of
weiltate
pairings
where
arbitrary
strings
can
act
as
public
keys
that
can
maintain
privacy
while
reducing
the
number
of
communicated
messages
despite
all
precautions
it
is
possible
that
malicious
nodes
will
send
fabricated
information
to
disrupt
the
operation
of
vehicular
networks
in
data
validation
is
used
to
detect
such
fabricated
information
under
the
assumption
that
honest
vehicles
are
more
prevalent
than
malicious
ones
sybil
attacks
where
a
malicious
node
can
claim
to
have
several
identities
each
bolstering
its
fabricated
claim
are
thwarted
by
distinguishing
vehicles
two
vehicles
cannot
occupy
the
same
position
at
the
same
time
position
information
is
similarly
exploited
to
prevent
sybil
attacks
in
also
discusses
approaches
to
prevent
vehicles
from
fabricating
their
position
information
data
aggregation
is
quite
important
for
maintaining
the
performance
of
vehicular
networks
and
ensuring
information
dissemination
references
and
consider
secure
data
aggregation
for
vehicular
networks
finally
detection
isolation
and
eviction
of
malicious
or
faulty
vehicles
from
a
vehicular
network
is
discussed
in
discussion
and
conclusions
vehicular
networks
as
they
are
conceptualized
today
are
already
quite
complex
however
the
applications
and
usage
scenarios
are
unpredictable
till
such
networks
are
actually
deployed
and
widely
utilized
for
example
the
burgeoning
of
community
wifi
networks
was
never
anticipated
in
the
early
days
of
its
inception
it
is
quite
possible
that
user
communities
of
vehicular
networks
may
arise
as
against
autonomous
vehicular
communities
or
clusters
and
people
will
choose
to
use
such
networks
in
ways
that
are
unique
and
challenging
in
terms
of
information
dissemination
and
assurance
already
content
distribution
could
be
a
problem
there
are
no
good
mechanisms
for
ensuring
rights
management
in
an
environment
with
good
connectivity
let
alone
in
one
with
limited
or
intermittent
connectivity
the
evolution
of
vehicular
networks
will
also
depend
on
how
open
they
are
the
safety
requirements
will
make
it
necessary
to
close
at
least
some
parts
of
the
network
to
ensure
limited
or
no
disruption
to
vehicular
safety
in
this
paper
a
survey
of
recent
research
in
the
areas
of
information
dissemination
and
assurance
in
vehicular
networks
was
presented
the

of
vehicular

classified
different
types
