as a result many
a result many students
have taken or considered

they require a lot
some students pointed out

courses in computer science
department are notorious being
are notorious being exceedingly
notorious being exceedingly difficult
being exceedingly difficult even
exceedingly difficult even for
difficult even for people
who already know the
already know the basics
know the basics of

pointed to this as
to this as a
this as a very
as a very unattractive
a very unattractive aspect
very unattractive aspect of

aspect of learning programming
dave programming is a
programming is a good
is a good skill
a good skill to
good skill to have
its not something like
not something like for
sure going for career
going for career no
for career no way
i thought its too
thought its too dull
its too dull for
too dull for me
personally because its solitary
i feel like i
feel like i have
like i have more
i have more social
skills i would rather
i would rather talk
would rather talk and
rather talk and interact
talk and interact with

third they feel that
they feel that what
feel that what is
that what is being
what is being taught
is being taught in
being taught in cs
taught in cs is
in cs is very
cs is very theoretical
they pointed out that
pointed out that cs
out that cs classes
that cs classes typically
require designing everything from
designing everything from scratch
everything from scratch and
from scratch and producing
scratch and producing outcomes
and producing outcomes that
are not immediately usable
this is not practical
is not practical for
not practical for most
practical for most students
for most students who
are not cs majors
not cs majors because
cs majors because the
majors because the cs
because the cs way
the cs way of
cs way of programming
way of programming is
of programming is not
programming is not only
is not only hard
for them but also
them but also takes
but also takes a
also takes a lot
takes a lot longer
a lot longer time

that are not gonna
are not gonna help
not gonna help them
i didnt want to
didnt want to deal
want to deal with
to deal with those
deal with those assignments
i want to learn
want to learn how
to learn how to
really get end up
get end up and
end up and do
up and do something
and do something that
do something that i
something that i can
that i can actually
i can actually physically
can actually physically use
i know that you
know that you need
that you need to
you need to learn
need to learn that
to learn that in
learn that in order

but thats not what
thats not what i
not what i need
lastly some students expressed
some students expressed their
students expressed their concern
expressed their concern that
their concern that cs
concern that cs does
that cs does not
cs does not consider
the impacts of computing

computing on human life
chris one of the
one of the things
of the things that
the things that i
things that i found
that i found which
i found which is
found which is really
which is really good
is really good about
really good about the
good about the it
program was that it
was that it really
that it really focuses
it really focuses more
really focuses more on
focuses more on the
more on the interaction
on the interaction between
people and computers instead
and computers instead of
computers instead of just
instead of just the
of just the very
just the very lowlevel
the very lowlevel programming
aspect which is something
which is something that
is something that i
something that i really
that i really missed
i really missed in
really missed in the
missed in the computer
in the computer science
there wasnt really anything
wasnt really anything that
really anything that computer
anything that computer science
that computer science can
offer me that i
me that i was

i was really looking
was really looking for
students comments about the

first students pointed out
students pointed out that
pointed out that most
existing academic programs are
academic programs are very
programs are very theorybased
are very theorybased and
very theorybased and not

a lot of practical
lot of practical things
of practical things and
practical things and am
things and am not
and am not real
am not real big
not real big into
i dont mind studying
dont mind studying a
mind studying a theory
studying a theory to
a theory to get
theory to get an
understanding of how software
of how software program
how software program works
software program works like
program works like the
works like the course
like the course i
the course i had
course i had last
semester we used a
we used a computer
used a computer design
a computer design tool
computer design tool to
design tool to help
tool to help us
to help us layout
help us layout a
us layout a processor
so we actually made
we actually made our
actually made our own
made our own little
our own little processors
own little processors and
little processors and one
processors and one of
and one of things
one of things you
of things you had
to connect a bunch

all these different little
if you do it
you do it manually

manually you will have
you will have a
will have a really
have a really big
a really big problem

big problem you can
use a choice of
a choice of different
choice of different algorithms
of different algorithms to
different algorithms to automatically
algorithms to automatically do
to automatically do it
automatically do it for
do it for you
i learned about different
learned about different algorithms
about different algorithms in
different algorithms in class
algorithms in class and
in class and used
class and used them
and used them in
used them in a
thats about the technology
about the technology that
the technology that id
technology that id like
that id like where
id like where i
can say all right
say all right i
all right i can
right i can use
i can use this
heres an algorithm you
will use it maybe
use it maybe i
it maybe i am
maybe i am like
i am like okay
am like okay because
like okay because i
okay because i am
because i am not
i am not really
big into theory and
into theory and just
theory and just kind
and just kind of
just kind of good
kind of good at
of good at research
good at research on
at research on that
research on that algorithm
its not all that
not all that useful
second students commented that

mostly these classes talk
these classes talk about
classes talk about and
talk about and how
about and how information
and how information is
how information is shared

i feel like its
feel like its not
like its not just
its not just studying
not just studying the
just studying the past
another criticism was that
criticism was that there
was that there are
that there are rigid
there are rigid boundaries
are rigid boundaries among
rigid boundaries among existing
disciplinary programs across campus
many classes are open
classes are open only
are open only to
open only to the
students enrolled in a
enrolled in a specific
in a specific program
many social science classes
deal with it issues
with it issues at

as he did not
he did not want
did not want to
not want to go
want to go too
to go too far
away from technical issues
from technical issues when
technical issues when choosing

general education requirements he
education requirements he decided
requirements he decided to
he decided to pick
decided to pick two
to pick two it
pick two it courses

he found that it
found that it is
difficult to find such
to find such courses
find such courses from
such courses from other
courses from other social
from other social science
other social science disciplines
