i recently
recently stepped
stepped down
down after
after serving
serving as
as chair
chair of
of pitts
pitts telecom
program for
for years
the fit
fit of
of a
a telecom
telecom program
program inside
inside sis
sis at
pitt has
has been
been an
an ongoing
ongoing discussion
discussion for
for most
most of
of my
my tenure
now as
as sis
tries to
to conform
conform to
to the
the evolving
evolving definition
definition of
of what
what an
an ischool
is the
the discussion
discussion of
of this
this fit
fit has
has taken
taken on
on even
even greater
in my
my discussions
discussions with
with dean
dean larsen
larsen in
in the
the last
last several
years i
i tried
tried to
to cast
cast the
the problem
problem to
to be
be part
part of
of a
a larger
larger one
one which
which is
just how
how wide
wide and
and deep
deep should
should an
an ischools
ischools curriculum
be this
this talkpaper
talkpaper represents
represents the
the state
state of
of this
this larger
discussion which
which dean
dean larsen
larsen and
and i
i believe
believe might
might be
be relevant
relevant to
to all
iconference attendees
the various
various academic
academic disciplines
disciplines are
are shown
shown to
to occupy
occupy the
the space
space of
of human
one objective
objective of
of this
this talkpaper
talkpaper is
is to
to propose
propose how
how the
ischool disciplines
disciplines fit
fit among
among the
the neighboring
neighboring disciplines
disciplines and
and which
disciplines are
are close
close or
or distant
the various
various classic
classic disciplines
disciplines are
seen to
to distribute
distribute differently
differently over
over a
a level
level of
of abstraction
dimension six
six levels
levels are
are defined
defined in
in which
which philosophy
philosophy is
is mostly
abstract and
and engineering
engineering is
is mostly
mostly concrete
then this
this talkpaper
discusses the
the idisciplines
idisciplines abstractionprofile
abstractionprofile in
in significant
curricular depth
depth is
is defined
defined as
as the
the number
number of
of layers
layers of
abstraction that
that should
should be
be included
included i
i argue
argue for
for five
five of
of the
the six
it is
is observed
observed that
that the
the idisciplines
idisciplines have
have different
disciplineneighbors at
at different
different levels
levels of
of abstraction
for example
at the
the highest
highest level
level of
of abstraction
abstraction the
the near
near neighbors
neighbors are
are philosophy
for ethics
ethics and
and sociology
sociology maslows
maslows needs
needs and
and at
at the
the lowest
lowest level
of abstraction
abstraction the
the near
near neighbors
neighbors are
are computer

and electrical
engineering implementing
implementing information

in between
between our
our near

are psychology

and others
the role

then the
the case
case is
is made
made that
that the
the ischools
subdisciplines six
six are
are defined
defined may
may have
have different
abstractionprofiles and
and different
different neighbors
curricular width
width is
is defined
defined as
as how
how close
close our
our curricula
curricula should
should get
to those
those of
of our
our near
near neighbors
finally holes
holes are
are identified
identified in
the spaces
spaces between
between the
the idisciplines
idisciplines and
and their
their neighbors
these holes
represent significant
significant areas
areas of
of human
human knowledge
knowledge which
which are
are typically
excluded from
from the
the academic
academic disciplines
disciplines at
at most
most universities
professionals who
who have
have filled
filled these
these holes
holes have
have done
done it
it perhaps
perhaps poorly
by their
their own
own cleverness
this talk

paper argues
argues that
that the
the ischools
should strive

has been
been to
to participate

has been
been how
how my
my telecom

at pitt
now as
as sis
sis tries
tries to
to conform

itself to
the evolving

of what
what an

is the
the discussion
discussion of
this fit

has taken
taken on

in my
my discussions
with dean

larsen in
in the
the last
last several
several years
years i
i have
have tried

to cast

depth as
as illustrated
illustrated in

we determine
our depth
depth by
by identifying
identifying how

how closely
closely our
discipline butts
butts up
up against

these neighbors
unfortunately its
its not
not so
so simple
perhaps some
some day
day it
it will
will be
when our
our discipline
discipline becomes
becomes more
more mature
but now
now these
these tasks
tasks are
complicated because
because the
the disciplines

we identify
identify as
as our

the point

here is
is not
not that
that we
agree that
that information

science has
has these
these exact
exact six
six subdisciplines

simply that
that we
we acknowledge
acknowledge that

has several
several subdisciplines

are something
something like

now but
eventually we
we must
how deep
the previous
previous section

six levels

so first
first we
we examine
examine how
how the

have very
very much
much here
here but
but all
all of

our students
students should
should understand

much of
