abstract
many
institutions
of
higher
education
in
the
us
are
offering
an
information
technology
it
education
program
at
an
undergraduate
level
so
far
not
many
studies
about
this
young
academic
program
have
explored
students
perspectives
students
perspectives
are
important
input
for
educators
to
implement
an
it
education
program
that
properly
addresses
students
needs
this
study
has
investigated
college
students
perceptions
and
expectations
for
formal
it
education
in
college
through
indepth
qualitative
interviews
interviewees
were
college
students
who
were
enrolled
in
courses
offered
from
an
it
minor
program
this
study
has
revealed
that
many
college
students
feel
that
there
is
a
void
in
college
education
in
dealing
with
issues
emerging
from
recent
developments
of
it
the
interviewees
indicated
that
the
existing
computer
science
program
did
not
satisfy
their
needs
students
perceived
that
it
is
something
that
they
would
have
to
confront
in
their
future
and
sought
it
education
regardless
of
their
fondness
for
using
and
learning
it
by
taking

introduction
recently
a
number
of
new
information
technology
it
education
programs
have
emerged
in
u
s
colleges
and
universities
in
addition
to
the
traditional
computerrelated
education
programs
the
new
it
programs
are
being
identified
with
titles
such
as
information
science
information
systems
information
technology
or
informatics
these
programs
have
been
developed
on
the
basis
that
there
is
a
niche
between
it
and
the
contexts
in
which
the
technologies
are
situated
in
terms
of
both
further
research
and
teaching
many
of
these
it
programs
are
providing
it
education
at
an
undergraduate
level
either
as
a
major
or
as
a
minor
while
the
it
programs
in
colleges
have
been
gaining
popularity
the
identity
of
the
it
programs
still
remains
fuzzy
and
the
nature
and
scope
of
it
education
are
still
being
debated
intensively
one
reason
may
be
that
the
new
area
of
study
is
still
young
and
the
existing
studies
have
not
had
enough
time
to
sufficiently
integrate
multiple
perspectives
from
various
stakeholders
of
collegelevel
it
education
one
of
the
most
important
stakeholder
groups
in
the
emerging
it
education
programs
is
college
students
however
most
previous
studies
have
rarely
examined
what
expectations
and
concerns
students
have
regarding
it
education
instead
they
have
discussed
educators
and
program
administrators
concerns
in
developing
and
administering
an
it
program
therefore
this
study
proposes
to
shift
attention
from
the
perspectives
of
program
developers
to
the
perspectives
of
college
students
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
college
level
it
education
the
big
research
question
that
guides
this
study
is
formulated
as
follows
what
are
college
students
perceptions
and
expectations
for
an
it
education
program
by
investigating
students
perspectives
this
study
eventually
aims
to
help
educators
answer
the
questions
regarding
the
identity
of
the
collegelevel
it
education
programs
related
studies
college
students
the
itsavvy
new
generation
in
a
large
body
of
literature
younger
generation
people
are
typically
described
as
more
techsavvy
than
older
generation
people
the
digital
divide
literature
has
long
been
discussing
the
inequality
that
exists
in
peoples
access
to
it
it
points
out
that
peoples
age
and
education
level
are
two
important
factors
that
make
a
big
difference
in
their
access
to
it
e

hargittai
and

college
students
are
considered
to
be
a
group
of
people
who
have
the
most
access
to
information
technologies
as
they
belong
to
the
younger
generation
that
has
grown
up
with
it
and
is
receiving
higher
education
that
often
goes
together
with
intensive
use
of
it
spontaneous
learning
a
significant
improvement
brought
by
the
development
of
userfriendly
information
technologies
is
that
those
technologies
have
become
easier
to
learn
nielson
a
usability
consultant
points
out
that
learnability
the
ease
of
initial
learning
is
one
of
the
top
attributes
in
any
good
useroriented
system
one
consequence
of
the
enhanced
learnability
is
that
user
spontaneous
learning
is
greatly
encouraged
many
people
acquire
it
skills
and
knowledge
spontaneously
through
informal
learning
embedded
in
their
daily
activities
rather
than
through
formal
training
or
written
manuals
in
contemplating
how
people
learn
to
use
computers
twidale
pays
special
attention
to
users
informal
help
giving
interactions
that
are
frequently
observed
in
workplaces
his
idea
of
overtheshoulder
learning
draws
on
education
theories
that
students
learn
cognitive
skills
most
effectively
through
informal
spontaneous
learning
opportunities
embedded
in
natural
classroom
settings
according
to
these
theories
interaction
within
peer
relationships
is
essential
when
students
learn
complex
cognitive
skills
e
g
vygotsky
rogoff
other
researchers
such
as
spliter
also
point
out
that
a
critical
part
of
it
learning
usually
occurs
in
users
social
interaction
with
peers
rather
than
through
formal
training
the
place
for
formal
it
education
in
college
as
discussed
above
college
students
are
very
active
users
of
it
and
they
acquire
it
competency
spontaneously
in
their
daily
lives
rather
than
through
any
formal
training
previous
studies
suggest
that
the
immediate
value
that
learners
attach
to
learning
computers
should
be
considered
in
thinking
about
it
education
facer
sutherland
furlong
and
furlong
point
out
that
there
is
a
fundamental
gap
between
the
reason
that
educators
and
parents
place
emphasis
on
computer
education
and
the
reason
that
children
value
computer
expertise
they
argue
that
while
policy
makers
and
parents
tend
to
view
computer
skills
in
terms
of
the
childrens
adaptability
to
the
future
world
of
work
the
actual
reason
that
young
children
value
it
expertise
is
that
obtaining
the
expertise
is
instrumental
in
shaping
their
identity
among
their
peer
groups
college
students
have
different
values
from
those
of
young
children
who
are
the
target
of
facer
et
al
study
college
students
are
situated
in
a
transitioning
period
from
education
to
the
real
world
therefore
college
years
are
the
time
when
careerrelated
decisions
are
important
to
students
developmental
psychologist
smolak
argues
that
occupationrelated
values
are
a
significant
part
of
college
students
identity
formation
it
implies
that
the
reason
that
college
students
seek
formal
it
education
may
be
closely
related
to
their
careerrelated
issues
also
many
related
studies
have
focused
on
computer
skills
rather
than
on
broad
it
education
which
includes
many
conceptual
parts
of
it
knowledge
other
than
just
computer
skills
if
college
students
are
generally
savvy
with
information
technologies
and
they
acquire
it
competency
more
through
informal
paths
then
what
would
be
the
place
for
formal
it
education
for
them
what
do
they
think
they
are
not
good
at
and
what
causes
them
to
consider
formal
it
education
methodology
as
the
development
of
the
collegelevel
it
programs
is
a
new
phenomenon
and
students
perceptions
on
these
programs
have
rarely
been
studied
there
is
no
strong
theoretical
framework
that
can
guide
this
study
to
answer
the
research
question
this
lack
of
a
strong
research
framework
requires
some
exploratory
research
that
identifies
the
major
issues
first
in
this
study
this
exploratory
research
was
performed
through
qualitative
indepth
interviewing
with
college
students
interview
participants
were
college
students
who
were
enrolled
in
one
or
more
courses
in
the
it
minor
program
in
a
large
midwestern
university
the
purposive
sampling
method
has
been
adopted
to
obtain
participants
from
various
majors
enrollment
in
an
it
class
was
taken
as
an
indication
of
students
interest
in
it
education
a
total
of
students
from
the
following
majors
were
interviewed
english
history
advertising
sociology
business
administration
computer
science
computer
engineering
chemical
engineering
etc
interviewees
included
male
students
and
female
students
sophomores
juniors
and
senior
students
were
interviewed
there
were
no
freshman
students
as
the
it
classes
require
sophomore
standing
for
confidentiality
pseudonyms
were
used
to
identify
the
interview
participants
throughout
the
study
interviews
were
performed
during
the
spring
and
fall
semesters
students
in
the
it
classes
were
given
a
brief
introduction
to
the
study
and
asked
to
sign
up
for
an
interview
session
each
interview
session
lasted
about
an
hour
the
interviews
were
conducted
in
a
semistructured
format
the
semistructured
format
allowed
the
interviewer
to
adjust
interview
questions
flexibly
to
get
indepth
understanding
of
each
interviewees
experiences
with
it
and
meanings
that
they
attach
to
it
education
findings
major
interests
in
it
education
from
the
interview
data
three
major
areas
of
interest
that
college
students
have
about
it
education
were
identified
learning
practical
handson
it
skills
the
interview
data
revealed
that
one
big
interest
that
college
students
have
regarding
it
education
is
learning
practical
handson
it
skills
it
broadly
means
any
type
of
digital
technology
that
processes
information
but
to
students
it
in
the
context
of
college
education
primarily
means
computers
rather
than
other
popular
consumer
it
devices
such
as
cell
phones
and
music
players
it
seems
that
their
interest
in
personal
computers
is
related
to
creating
practical
digital
artifacts
on
their
own
these
digital
artifacts
include
their
personal
web
pages
portfolios
for
jobs
and
tools
to
support
the
groups
that
they
belong
to
emily
a
psychology
student
expressed
how
excited
she
was
when
she
learned
some
practical
handson
it
skills
from
an
it
class
emily
the
things
that
we
created
in
the
class
it
was
something
that
actually
worked
and
could
actually
be
used
we
created
things
that
i
feel
that
we
accomplished
something
which
is
kind
of
cool
creating
something
on
computers
usually
involves
programming
however
students
clearly
indicated
that
what
they
are
interested
in
is
not
the
programming
per
se
which
cs
people
would
do
their
interest
in
programming
is
limited
to
some
types
of
web
programming
that
are
needed
to
make
their
own
stuff
figure
interests
in
learning
practical
handson
it
skills
learning
about
social
implications
of
it
students
also
showed
interest
in
learning
about
implications
of
it
use
on
people
and
society
they
are
interested
in
learning
how
people
use
it
and
what
implications
it
use
has
for
society
but
not
necessarily
interested
in
using
it
products
proficiently
or
learning
handson
it
skills
two
students
from
english
and
business
respectively
described
their
interest
in
learning
the
social
implications
of
it
implementation
jenna
my
expectations
were
not
so
much
relating
it
classes
to
technical
stuffbut
more
relating
it
to
culture
and
current
events
more
like
how
the
computers
have
evolved
all
i
really
thought
about
it
was
i
didnt
really
think
it
would
be
too
technical
rachel
ive
always
liked
learning
about
technologies
and
liked
how
people
use
it
and
how
it
affects
people
i
dont
necessarily
like
using
technology
itself
i
took
a
class
last
semester
it
was
a
communications
class
and
it
was
a
lot
about
tv
internet
and
different
types
of
media
and
how
they
affect
society
and
different
groups
and
different
stereotypes
i
thought
it
was
interesting
so
i
thought
that
the
it
minor
is
fairly
similar
to
that
these
comments
indicate
that
even
students
who
are
not
very
active
in
using
it
products
feel
the
need
for
some
kind
of
it
education
their
focus
on
the
impact
of
it
is
clearly
different
from
the
focus
of
the
established
approaches
of
cs
or
other
engineering
fields
interest
in
humancomputer
interaction
humancomputer
interaction
hci
is
another
area
that
many
students
showed
interest
in
regarding
it
education
chris
a
philosophy
major
focuses
on
computers
less
as
technologies
but
more
as
peoples
tools
for
communicating
chris
i
am
more
interested
in
computing
as
interaction
less
than
computing
as
a
goal
and
end
itself
if
people
are
interested
in
studying
how
people
interact
with
computers
how
computers
shape
their
lives
the
it
program
is
an
ideal
place
to
investigate
some
of
that
knowledge
students
perceive
hci
as
an
important
issue
to
pursue
in
higher
education
because
it
is
related
to
many
current
changes
in
society
jack
that
class
design
information
interfaces
was
very
helpful
because
i
think
a
lot
of
things
are
either
on
the
web
right
now
or
going
in
that
direction
i
think
usability
is
really
important
because
ive
been
on
so
many
websites
not
being
able
to
find
a
button
or
not
knowing
where
to
click
and
thats
one
of
the
big
issues
it
just
does
not
allow
people
design
for
usability
some
students
also
view
hci
as
a
gateway
through
which
nontechnical
students
can
get
into
the
study
of
it
jenna
because
i
am
not
really
very
experienced
with
computers
i
asked
the
it
advisor
what
classes
would
be
less
technical
and
more
underlines
of
computers
and
culture
human
interaction
with
computers
it
seems
that
hci
is
a
major
area
of
it
education
by
hci
students
mean
not
a
narrowly
defined
subarea
of
it
but
rather
peoples
interaction
with
computers
in
a
broad
sense
patterns
found
among
the
major
interests
interesting
patterns
were
found
among
the
major
interests
the
first
two
interests
interest
in
learning
handson
it
skills
and
interest
in
learning
social
implications
tended
to
be
negatively
correlated
those
who
were
more
interested
in
acquiring
practical
handson
computing
stuff
tended
to
be
less
interested
in
discussing
social
implications
of
it
those
who
showed
more
interest
in
learning
about
social
implications
of
it
tended
to
be
less
interested
in
learning
technical
stuff
also
some
common
underlying
interests
were
found
in
all
three
interests
first
most
of
the
students
showed
interested
in
the
practical
aspects
of
it
education
second
all
the
three
interests
were
focused
around
userlevel
issues
students
take
it
classes
to
learn
to
make
their
websites
to
make
their
own
portfolio
to
conduct
their
group
project
or
to
learn
how
it
implementation
affects
endusers
like
themselves
i
am
not
good
at
computers
conflicting
attitude
towards
their
it
competency
many
students
had
conflicting
attitudes
regarding
their
it
competency
while
they
said
they
use
it
all
the
time
for
their
school
work
and
socializing
purposes
many
of
them
rated
their
overall
competency
in
using
it
not
very
high
with
a
comment
like
i
am
not
good
at
computers
it
seems
that
their
intensive
use
of
computers
for
school
work
and
social
purposes
does
not
count
as
it
competency
for
them
a
lot
of
times
the
feeling
of
incompetence
came
from
their
inability
to
do
programming
jack
technology
i
do
utilize
it
a
lot
i
think
im
pretty
familiar
with
a
lot
of
the
it
technology
in
terms
of
the
social
use
utilizing
different
technologies
the
one
thing
that
i
dont
feel
comfortable
with
is
the
coding
itself
it
is
noteworthy
that
students
did
not
describe
their
it
competency
as
a
standalone
technical
skill
without
a
context
most
times
students
described
their
it
competency
in
relation
to
some
area
expertise
for
example
a
journalism
student
abby
indicated
that
she
is
not
competent
to
sit
down
and
write
a
program
by
herself
but
that
her
it
skills
would
be
good
enough
to
perform
her
work
in
the
journalism
area
abby
for
the
future
ill
need
to
know
more
about
online
journalism
but
could
i
sit
down
and
make
a
web
page
no
i
think
i
would
need
more
interaction
i
think
i
have
enough
base
knowledge
to
accomplish
anything
that
i
would
want
to
accomplish
if
i
want
to
learn
more
i
could
figure
it
out
on
my
own
without
struggling
too
much
it
seems
that
students
feel
that
their
it
competency
is
good
enough
if
their
it
skills
and
knowledge
are
functional
in
performing
what
they
need
to
do
perceptions
about
the
existing
cs
program
the
interview
data
revealed
that
many
of
the
interviewees
have
some
sort
of
interest
in
learning
issues
in
computing
as
a
result
many
students
have
taken
or
considered
taking
a
cs
class
most
students
reported
that
the
cs
classes
they
tried
did
not
satisfy
their
needs
first
students
generally
perceived
that
computer
science
is
very
hard
cs
classes
are
usually
considered
to
be
hard
because
they
require
a
lot
of
math
background
some
students
pointed
out
that
cs
classes
are
daunting
even
for
people
who
already
have
some
level
of
technical
competency
outside
of
class
chris
i
joined
the
university
with
very
sporadic
knowledge
of
computing
i
had
fairly
good
knowledge
of
coding
and
software
systems
however
computer
programming
courses
in
computer
science
department
are
notorious
being
exceedingly
difficult
even
for
people
who
already
know
the
basics
of
the
programming
students
also
commented
that
the
class
atmosphere
of
cs
classes
is
not
very
friendly
to
novices
and
lessexperienced
people
second
the
negative
stereotype
of
cs
work
influences
students
perceptions
of
cs
education
many
students
believed
that
cs
work
typically
requires
long
hours
of
working
alone
with
tedious
tasks
and
pointed
to
this
as
a
very
unattractive
aspect
of
learning
programming
dave
programming
is
a
good
skill
to
have
its
not
something
like
for
sure
going
for
career
no
way
i
thought
its
too
dull
for
me
personally
because
its
solitary
i
feel
like
i
have
more
social
skills
i
would
rather
talk
and
interact
with
people
on
group
work
than
have
just
me
in
a
closet
with
a
computer
third
they
feel
that
what
is
being
taught
in
cs
is
very
theoretical
rather
than
practical
they
pointed
out
that
cs
classes
typically
require
designing
everything
from
scratch
and
producing
outcomes
that
are
not
immediately
usable
this
is
not
practical
for
most
students
who
are
not
cs
majors
because
the
cs
way
of
programming
is
not
only
hard
for
them
but
also
takes
a
lot
longer
time
than
necessary
to
get
what
they
want
kelly
my
friends
have
had
taken
them
they
come
home
talking
about
their
really
arbitrary
assignments
things
that
are
not
gonna
help
them
i
didnt
want
to
deal
with
those
assignments
i
want
to
learn
how
to
really
get
end
up
and
do
something
that
i
can
actually
physically
use
create
a
product
i
know
that
you
need
to
learn
that
in
order
to
get
to
that
but
thats
not
what
i
need
lastly
some
students
expressed
their
concern
that
cs
does
not
consider
the
impacts
of
computing
on
human
life
chris
one
of
the
things
that
i
found
which
is
really
good
about
the
it
program
was
that
it
really
focuses
more
on
the
interaction
between
people
and
computers
instead
of
just
the
very
lowlevel
programming
aspect
which
is
something
that
i
really
missed
in
the
computer
science
department
there
wasnt
really
anything
that
computer
science
can
offer
me
that
i
was
really
looking
for
students
comments
about
the
cs
program
indicated
that
the
focus
of
existing
computing
education
does
not
go
very
well
with
noncs
students
needs
for
computing
education
perceived
gap
in
college
education
students
reported
that
they
feel
some
gap
in
current
college
education
in
terms
of
education
for
it
first
students
pointed
out
that
most
existing
academic
programs
are
very
theorybased
and
not
practical
nathan
is
a
computer
engineering
major
he
described
his
experience
that
all
the
theoretical
knowledge
that
he
had
obtained
from
his
study
was
not
very
useful
in
performing
his
work
assignment
nathan
i
do
like
a
lot
of
practical
things
and
am
not
real
big
into
studying
theories
i
dont
mind
studying
a
theory
to
get
an
understanding
of
how
software
program
works
like
the
course
i
had
last
semester
we
used
a
computer
design
tool
to
help
us
layout
a
processor
so
we
actually
made
our
own
little
processors
and
one
of
things
you
had
to
connect
a
bunch
of
different
wires
between
all
these
different
little
pins
if
you
do
it
manually
you
will
have
a
really
big
problem
you
can
use
a
choice
of
different
algorithms
to
automatically
do
it
for
you
so
i
learned
about
different
algorithms
in
class
and
used
them
in
a
practical
way
thats
about
the
technology
that
id
like
where
i
can
say
all
right
i
can
use
this
heres
an
algorithm
you
will
use
it
maybe
i
am
like
okay
because
i
am
not
really
big
into
theory
and
just
kind
of
good
at
research
on
that
algorithm
its
not
all
that
useful
second
students
commented
that
most
academic
programs
focus
on
history
and
are
slow
at
embracing
issues
of
current
affairs
and
recent
developments
this
complaint
appears
over
a
wide
range
of
academic
disciplines
dave
a
political
science
major
mentions
that
political
science
deals
more
with
historical
stuff
than
the
changes
that
he
is
experiencing
right
now
dave
courses
in
my
major
deal
a
whole
lot
of
government
stuff
seem
more
of
just
history
looking
back
at
the
history
of
government
while
in
this
it
course
i
feel
like
what
we
are
studying
is
going
right
now
i
enjoy
that
because
its
something
that
i
feel
like
i
am
in
actually
a
part
of
because
i
am
participating
on
the
internet
which
mostly
these
classes
talk
about
and
how
information
is
shared
through
different
chat
i
feel
like
its
not
just
studying
the
past
its
studying
now
another
criticism
was
that
there
are
rigid
boundaries
among
existing
disciplinary
programs
across
campus
many
classes
are
open
only
to
the
students
enrolled
in
a
specific
program
many
social
science
classes
deal
with
it
issues
at
an
upperundergraduate
level
these
upperlevel
courses
usually
require
several
prerequisite
courses
within
a
specific
discipline
there
is
no
social
science
class
that
is
entirely
devoted
to
discussions
about
it
zachary
a
cs
major
is
taking
an
it
course
that
fulfills
his
general
education
requirements
for
social
sciences
he
is
very
much
into
his
study
in
cs
and
is
also
interested
in
different
kinds
of
discussion
about
computers
and
other
technologies
as
he
did
not
want
to
go
too
far
away
from
technical
issues
when
choosing
social
science
courses
for
his
general
education
requirements
he
decided
to
pick
two
it
courses
that
satisfy
the
general
education
requirements
he
found
that
it
is
difficult
to
find
such
courses
from
other
social
science
disciplines
because
other
disciplines
usually
offer
technologyrelated
courses
only
at
a
higher
level
for
junior
and
senior
students
in
their
fields
zachary
if
i
am
looking
for
a
social
science
course
that
deals
with
it
thatll
be
five
courses
to
get
to
anything
that
really
about
computers
instead
of
two
introductory
it
courses
as
it
is
increasingly
being
adopted
in
many
settings
in
everyday
life
students
do
have
some
sort
of
sense
that
there
might
be
some
education
program
on
it
on
campus
even
without
explicit
knowledge
this
is
expressed
in
the
conversation
with
brad
an
economics
major
who
is
not
very
fond
of
working
with
it
heekyung
did
you
know
that
there
is
an
it
minor
on
campus
brad
i
guess
i
wouldve
i
dont
know
explicitly
but
i
figured
that
there
would
beit
isnt
something
that
im
extremely
interested
in
so
i
wouldnt
have
considered
it
i
wouldnt
look
into
finding
whether
there
was
but
yeah
i
guess
i
didnt
not
explicitly
but
i
would
have
if
it
was
something
i
was
interested
in
i
would
have
figured
that
you
can
you
can
get
an
it
minor
i
had
this
feeling
that
there
is
something
like
an
it
minor
on
campus
i
figured
it
would
be
there
but
i
didnt
actually
know
it
seems
that
their
perceived
needs
for
it
education
have
to
do
with
their
perceived
gap
in
current
college
education
reasons
for
choosing
the
it
minor
while
students
choose
their
major
based
on
what
they
like
and
what
they
are
good
at
the
interview
data
showed
that
students
choose
the
it
minor
because
of
its
practical
value
that
it
education
bears
to
them
a
few
students
reported
that
they
chose
it
courses
because
they
generally
like
to
work
with
it
however
for
many
other
students
it
is
something
that
they
will
have
to
acquire
knowledge
about
for
their
future
whether
they
like
it
or
not
or
whether
they
are
good
at
dealing
with
it
or
not
many
students
from
various
majors
from
english
to
computer
science
commonly
perceive
that
it
is
not
very
exciting
but
something
that
they
will
need
to
learn
eventually
for
their
future
life
beyond
education
kate
a
humanities
student
has
been
hesitant
to
embrace
new
technical
things
since
she
was
young
however
she
feels
that
it
is
something
that
she
would
need
to
confront
in
developing
her
future
career
anyway
kate
repeated
that
learning
it
is
very
hard
for
her
indicating
that
she
is
taking
the
it
minor
for
its
instrumental
value
not
because
of
her
fondness
of
what
is
being
taught
in
it
education
kate
technical
things
are
hard
but
worth
learning
especially
i
am
coming
into
the
graduate
school
of
library
and
information
science
next
year
so
i
know
that
i
am
gonna
need
to
know
things
about
internet
and
technology
its
just
hard
its
hard
for
me
zachary
a
cs
major
also
talks
about
the
need
to
learn
about
it
regardless
of
his
willingness
to
stick
to
a
cs
job
in
his
mind
a
cs
job
is
a
job
that
focuses
on
programming
as
opposed
to
an
it
job
which
is
more
about
providing
technical
support
to
other
people
zachary
i
know
i
am
most
likely
ending
up
with
being
a
coder
somewhere
i
will
have
to
use
code
repositories
knowledge
bases
a
lot
of
tech
support
things
they
put
that
in
a
repository
students
said
that
they
chose
the
it
minor
because
they
believed
the
study
of
it
supplements
their
major
field
well
abby
a
journalism
major
explained
her
need
to
learn
it
to
be
up
front
in
her
area
of
study
abby
i
feel
like
it
the
it
minor
complements
my
major
journalism
as
where
the
technology
of
journalism
is
going
and
what
new
mediums
we
will
be
using
to
portray
the
news
i
do
think
they
are
hard
and
i
havent
understood
everything
they
said
but
i
think
overall
i
have
a
much
better
grasp
of
technology
than
i
did
another
student
mentioned
that
he
is
taking
the
it
minor
to
narrow
down
his
expertise
in
writing
to
an
itrelated
subfield
for
example
to
become
a
lawyer
specialized
in
cyberspace
law
larry
i
am
going
to
law
school
and
i
am
planning
on
doing
something
very
related
to
it
or
technology
in
general
maybe
something
like
cyber
law
another
important
reason
is
to
differentiate
themselves
from
others
with
similar
qualifications
kelly
is
a
humanities
student
who
is
planning
to
continue
her
study
in
library
and
information
science
after
college
she
thinks
that
there
are
so
many
librarianstobe
who
have
similar
qualifications
she
considers
it
competency
as
something
that
would
make
her
unique
by
showing
her
wellroundedness
kelly
i
feel
like
itll
at
least
give
me
a
little
bit
more
a
wellrounded
aspect
just
than
just
doing
humanities
having
any
sort
of
it
competency
is
gonna
put
you
so
much
higher
in
the
rankings
as
far
as
finding
positions
than
anyone
else
most
students
comments
indicated
that
some
practical
value
of
receiving
it
education
rather
than
an
inherent
interest
in
it
is
a
critical
factor
in
their
decision
to
take
the
it
minor
factors
that
influence
students
choice
of
it
minor
students
comments
about
the
it
education
program
indicate
that
there
would
be
numerous
challenges
in
building
and
administering
a
successful
undergraduate
it
education
program
first
of
all
the
it
minor
is
optional
to
students
unlike
a
major
students
mentioned
that
they
have
to
weigh
carefully
the
value
of
doing
the
it
minor
with
other
valuable
opportunities
that
they
could
possibly
take
such
as
internships
study
abroad
opportunities
parttime
jobs
campus
honors
programs
and
participating
in
student
organizations
another
important
factor
in
doing
the
it
minor
is
how
flexible
the
course
requirements
within
their
major
are
while
some
social
science
majors
do
encourage
students
to
have
a
minor
with
an
additional
requirement
like
hours
of
supporting
coursework
other
majors
leave
no
room
for
students
to
seek
another
interest
nathan
who
is
a
senior
in
computer
engineering
cautioned
that
a
student
in
his
major
has
to
be
very
careful
in
choosing
to
do
something
outside
of
his
major
nathan
in
engineering
if
youre
going
to
take
courses
that
arent
technical
a
lot
of
times
you
need
to
make
sure
if
those
are
counting
for
something
for
him
if
he
takes
something
outside
his
major
without
confirming
that
the
outside
course
counts
towards
something
for
his
degree
it
would
cause
trouble
in
finishing
his
degree
on
time
some
students
expressed
their
worries
that
other
important
people
like
hiring
managers
would
not
know
what
the
it
minor
is
rachel
a
business
student
made
an
interesting
comment
based
on
her
interviewing
experience
for
an
internship
rachel
in
my
interviews
i
asked
some
of
the
recruiters
what
would
they
think
of
the
it
minor
i
think
a
lot
of
recruiters
would
misunderstand
they
think
it
as
computer
science
so
they
think
oh
youre
an
accounting
major
we
need
you
to
do
accounting
we
dont
need
you
to
fix
computers
thats
their
idea
i
dont
think
they
would
understand
what
it
is
fixing
a
computer
may
be
a
popular
stereotype
about
it
work
rachels
comment
signals
that
raising
other
stakeholders
awareness
about
an
it
education
program
would
be
an
important
factor
for
students
to
have
a
positive
impression
about
an
it
program
if
other
people
who
have
significant
influence
on
students
future
do
not
understand
what
an
it
program
is
it
would
make
students
hesitant
about
choosing
an
it
program
conclusion
in
this
study
students
from
different
majors
showed
diverse
interests
in
it
education
however
the
existing
computer
science
program
does
not
seem
to
respond
to
those
interests
students
also
pointed
out
that
higher
education
in
general
has
a
gap
in
addressing
the
issues
emerging
from
increasing
implementation
of
it
in
addition
most
students
indicated
that
they
are
anticipating
some
practical
advantages
by
enrolling
in
an
it
education
program
the
findings
also
signal
that
marketing
of
an
it
program
should
be
directed
not
only
to
students
but
to
various
stakeholder
groups
whose
perspectives
have
significant
influence
on
college
students
students
comments
also
implied
that
it
education
is
facing
many
challenges
it
seems
that
many
of
the
challenges
for
an
it
program
come
from
its
interdisciplinary
nature
it
programs
are
usually
built
as
an
interdisciplinary
endeavor
as
they
usually
start
with
the
recognition
that
there
is
a
niche
between
technologies
and
their
social
contexts
to
fill
the
niche
the
it
programs
emphasize
gathering
multiple
perspectives
for
viewing
computing
from
sociology
from
communications
and
from
computer
science
etc
to
sustain
an
interdisciplinary
program
gathering
and
organizing
supports
from
many
disciplines
is
crucial
berghel
and
sallach
have
already
observed
that
many
it
programs
are
being
organized
at
a
university
level
rather
than
at
a
departmental
level
the
scope
of
this
study
is
limited
to
an
it
minor
program
in
a
specific
university
therefore
the
findings
may
not
hold
for
students
in
other
universities
or
in
other
it
programs
that
are
offered
as
a
major
program
this
case
study
was
conducted
with
the
intention
of
getting
an
indepth
understanding
of
students
perspectives
there
are
not
many
previous
studies
about
students
perceptions
about
it
education
at
this
stage
the
benefits
of
identifying
students
various
issues
involved
in
receiving
it
education
outweigh
the
value
of
getting
generalizable
findings
across
a
large
number
of
college
students
the
findings
strongly
suggest
that
students
expect
an
it
education
program
that
has
a
different
focus
than
that
of
the
other
existing
computing
programs
just
me
in
a
closet
with
a
computer
may
be
a
common
portrait
of
programmingcomputer
science
that
students
have
wanting
something
different
from
that
is
a
major
reason
that
students
seek
it
education
students
from
various
majors
want
some
computing
education
that
is
more
interesting
more
practical
and
more
meaningful
than
cs
this
study
is
valuable
in
that
it
delivers
this
anticipation
to
the
it
