first we
we wish
wish to
to disaggregate
disaggregate the
the notion
notion of

knowledge itself
itself and
specifically it
it knowledge
knowledge into
into two
two components
components knowwhat
and knowhow
no doubt

it could

be further
further subdivided
subdivided but
but at
a first
first level
level of
of approximation
approximation this
this heuristic
heuristic division
division reminds
reminds us
that technology
technology itself
itself is
is both
both a
a knowledgesystem

and a
a practice
it is
is both
both a
a highly
highly systematized
systematized explicitly
explicitly formulated
formulated and
repeatedly tested
tested set
set of
of logically
logically nested
nested truths
truths which
which allows
allows us
us to
know what
what laws

hold and
and a
a highly
highly fluid
fluid set
set of
of practices

and implicit
implicit codes
codes which
which allow
allow us
us to

there has
has been
been much
much historical

knowwhat forms
forms of

but less
less on

socially coded
coded set
set of

we wish
wish to
to lump
under the
the heading

of knowhow
we suggest
suggest that
that understanding
knowhow will
will help
help us
us better
better understand
understand some
some of
of the
the ways
ways in
which groups
groups of

software developers
developers share
share knowledge
software development
development innovates
innovates and
and it
it knowledge
knowledge travels
along transnational
transnational circuits
circuits of
of practitioners
thus the
the policy
policy areas
areas that
that are
are elucidated
elucidated include
include questions
questions such
as where
where should
should we
we look
look for
for the
the next
next wave
wave of
of ideas
ideas in

development to
to fuel
fuel the

we suggest
suggest in

that many
many sites

oftenoverlooked creativity
creativity and

innovation may
exist in
in marginal
marginal networks
networks outside
outside the
the mainstream
mainstream areas
areas of

below we
we briefly
briefly explain
explain what
what we
we mean
mean by
by knowhow
we then
explore why
why a
a more
more complex
complex ethnographic

understanding of

might elucidate
elucidate the
the ways
ways in

which software
software innovation
occurs and
and how
how this
this shifts

finally we
we explore

the onus

furthermore this
this knowhow
knowhow needs

because software
software technology
technology and

information ecologies

knowhow is
is the
the link
link between
between creativity
creativity and

creativity can
can be
be described
described as
as the
the generation

ideas while
innovation is
is the
the practical
practical application
application of
of those
those ideas

knowhow is
is the
the procedural
procedural and

knowledge that
that is
is needed
needed to
to perform
perform the
the transformation
in information
information technology
technology knowhow
knowhow takes
takes many
forms such
such as
as working
working knowledge
knowledge of
of application
application program

the craft
craft skills

and the
the judgment

this it
it knowhow
knowhow is
is highly

that it
it needs
