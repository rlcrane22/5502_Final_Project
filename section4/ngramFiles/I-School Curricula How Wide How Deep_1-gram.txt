personal
comment
i
recently
stepped
down
after
serving
as
chair
of
pitts
telecom
program
for
years
the
fit
of
a
telecom
program
inside
sis
at
pitt
has
been
an
ongoing
discussion
for
most
of
my
tenure
now
as
sis
tries
to
conform
to
the
evolving
definition
of
what
an
ischool
is
the
discussion
of
this
fit
has
taken
on
even
greater
relevance
in
my
discussions
with
dean
larsen
in
the
last
several
years
i
tried
to
cast
the
problem
to
be
part
of
a
larger
one
which
is
just
how
wide
and
deep
should
an
ischools
curriculum
be
this
talkpaper
represents
the
state
of
this
larger
discussion
which
dean
larsen
and
i
believe
might
be
relevant
to
all
iconference
attendees
abstract
the
various
academic
disciplines
are
shown
to
occupy
the
space
of
human
knowledge
one
objective
of
this
talkpaper
is
to
propose
how
the
ischool
disciplines
fit
among
the
neighboring
disciplines
and
which
disciplines
are
close
or
distant
the
various
classic
disciplines
are
seen
to
distribute
differently
over
a
level
of
abstraction
dimension
six
levels
are
defined
in
which
philosophy
is
mostly
abstract
and
engineering
is
mostly
concrete
then
this
talkpaper
discusses
the
idisciplines
abstractionprofile
in
significant
detail
curricular
depth
is
defined
as
the
number
of
layers
of
abstraction
that
should
be
included
i
argue
for
five
of
the
six
it
is
observed
that
the
idisciplines
have
different
disciplineneighbors
at
different
levels
of
abstraction
for
example
at
the
highest
level
of
abstraction
the
near
neighbors
are
philosophy
for
ethics
and
sociology
maslows
needs
and
at
the
lowest
level
of
abstraction
the
near
neighbors
are
computer
science
and
electrical
engineering
implementing
information
systems
in
between
our
near
neighbors
are
psychology
cognition
business
law
literature
political
science
and
others
the
role
of
a
professional
school
is
factored
in
then
the
case
is
made
that
the
ischools
subdisciplines
six
are
defined
may
have
different
abstractionprofiles
and
different
neighbors
curricular
width
is
defined
as
how
close
our
curricula
should
get
to
those
of
our
near
neighbors
finally
holes
are
identified
in
the
spaces
between
the
idisciplines
and
their
neighbors
these
holes
represent
significant
areas
of
human
knowledge
which
are
typically
excluded
from
the
academic
disciplines
at
most
universities
professionals
who
have
filled
these
holes
have
done
it
perhaps
poorly
by
their
own
cleverness
this
talk
paper
argues
that
the
ischools
should
strive
to
fill
those
holes
but
doing
so
may
require
even
greater
curricular
width

abstract
the
emerging
discipline
we
call
information
science
is
shown
to
fit
among
its
neighboring
disciplines
after
proposing
any
academic
disciplines
six
levels
of
abstraction
and
using
them
to
define
curricular
depth
detailed
investigation
reveals
that
is
butts
against
different
neighboring
disciplines
at
different
levels
then
after
proposing
is
six
subdisciplines
they
are
shown
not
only
to
have
different
distributions
across
their
levels
of
abstracttion
but
also
to
butt
up
against
different
neighboring
disciplines
an
ischools
role
as
a
professional
school
is
factored
into
this
discussion
curricular
width
is
defined
as
how
close
a
curriculum
should
get
to
its
near

then
holes
are
identified
in
the

between

these
holes
represent
areas
of
human

which
are
typically

from

the
academic

at

it
is
argued
here
that

introduction
the
paper
is
introduced
on
a
personal
note
i
recently
stepped
down
after
serving
for
years
as
the
chair
of
the
telecommunications
program
at
the
university
of
pittsburgh
one
of
my
more
important
activities
during
these
years
has
been
to
participate
with
the
chairs
of
the
nations
other
telecom
programs
in
defining
telecom
as
an
academic
discipline
similar
to
the
consortium
of
ischools
the
nations
tprograms
have
tried
to
organized
themselves
most
recently
under
the
banner
of
the
international
telecommunications
education
and
research
association
itera
a
corresponding
paper
which
asks
the
same
questions
of
telecom
programs
that
this
paper
asks
of
ischools
will
be
presented
at
the
itera
conference
a
related
ongoing
discussion
during
my
tenure
as
telecom
program
chair
has
been
how
my
telecom
program
fits
inside
the
school
of
information
sciences
at
pitt
now
as
sis
tries
to
conform
itself
to
the
evolving
definition
of
what
an
ischool
is
the
discussion
of
this
fit
has
taken
on
even
greater
relevance
in
my
discussions
with
dean
larsen
in
the
last
several
years
i
have
tried
to
cast
the
problem
to
be
part
of
a
larger
one
which
is
how
wide
and
how
deep
should
an
ischools
curriculum
be
this
paper
represents
the
state
of
this
larger
discussion
which
dean
larsen
and
i
believe
might
be
relevant
to
all
the
ischools
so
this
paper
proposes
a
twodimensional
universe
for
academic
disciplines
attempts
to
place
is
in
this
universe
and
discusses
the
fit
and
the
holes
the
paper
is
not
the
beall
and
endall
on
this
topic
instead
it
is
intended
to
act
as
a
framework
that
might
guide
the
discussion
which
completes
what
this
paper
only
begins
the
paper
asks
more
questions
than
it
answers
and
in
fact
six
questions
are
explicitly
stated
the
space
of
human
knowledge
academic
disciplines
occupy
a
multidimensional
space
of
human
knowledge
this
paper
focuses
on
two
of
these
dimensions
as
shown
in
figure
below
two
dimensions
the
content
dimension
shown
horizontally
is
a
spectrum
that
runs
from
the
fine
arts
through
the
humanities
and
social
sciences
to
the
hard
sciences
the
six
columns
represent
only
a
few
of
the
hundred
or
more
recognized
academic
disciplines
the
abstraction
dimension
shown
vertically
is
a
spectrum
of
the
level
of
detail
and
theory
that
is
typically
investigated
in
each
respective
discipline
while
figure
shows
only
three
levels
of
abstraction
this
paper
is
based
on
these
six
rationale
a
disciplines
broad
justification
framework
broad
theory
that
establishes
terminology
in
which
to
base
generalized
discussion
and
a
structure
for
the
discipline
practice
the
details
that
are
needed
by
the
people
who
will
work
in
the
field
of
endeavor
that
corresponds
to
the
discipline
optimization
detailed
generalization
and
theory
for
the
purpose
of
proving
results
and
determining
various
optimizations
and
best
practices
implementation
study
of
underlying
infrastructure
fundamentals
basic
underlying
principles
for
example
consider
education
as
an
academic
discipline
its
rationale
includes
the
disciplines
rather
selfevident
purpose
and
motivation
and
its
framework
includes
issues
like
curriculum
design
this
paper
its
practice
includes
issues
like
classroom
skill
boardmanship
enunciation
etc
and
its
optimization
is
the
body
of
knowledge
typically
covered
in
a
course
on
ed
psych
whose
principles
would
presumably
help
us
be
better
teachers
and
write
better
books
educations
implementation
level
includes
topics
like
knowing
how
to
use
powerpoint
the
education
discipline
has
few
underlying
fundamentals
like
we
find
in
physics
quantum
theory
or
biology
genetics
one
might
be
the
elusive
definition
of
learning
the
specification
of
these
levels
is
certainly
arguable
some
might
be
combined
and
more
might
be
defined
the
discussion
in
this
paper
is
based
more
on
agreeing
that
academic
disciplines
have
levels
like
these
than
on
the
details
of
what
the
levels
are
however
the
next
subsection
provides
a
little
justification
question
are
these
the
appropriate
levels
of
abstraction
sophistication
and
theory
two
other
concepts
related
to
abstraction
are
sophistication
and
theory
sophistication
relates
to
the
maturity
of
the
student
while
abstraction
relates
to
the
applicability
of
the
material
as
shown
in
figure
they
are
not
unrelated
mature
scholars
appreciate
abstract
issues
like
rationale
and
fundamentals
while
immature
students
demand
to
know
what
good
is
this
this
paper
separates
theory
into
three
layers
the
evennumbered
levels
of
abstraction
in
the
list
above
framework
optimization
and
fundamentals
level
s
separation
from
level
is
based
on
an
observation
from
einstein
in
his
essay
on
the
method
of
theoretical
physics
i
want
now
to
glance
for
a
moment
at
the
development
of
the
theoretical
method
and
while
doing
so
especially
to
observe
the
relation
of
pure
theory
to
the
totality
of
the
data
of
experience
here
is
the
eternal
antithesis
of
the
two
inseparable
constituents
of
human
knowledge
experience
and
reason
within
the
sphere
of
physics
pure
logical
thinking
can
give
us
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
world
of
experience
all
knowledge
about
reality
begins
with
experience
and
terminates
in
it
conclusions
obtained
by
purely
rational
processes
are
so
far
as
reality
is
concerned
entirely
empty
but
if
experience
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
our
knowledge
about
reality
what
role
is
there
left
for
reason
in
science
a
complete
system
of
theoretical
physics
consists
of
concepts
and
basic
laws
to
interrelate
those
concepts
and
of
consequences
to
be
derived
by
logical
deduction
reason
gives
the
structure
to
the
system
the
data
of
experience
and
their
mutual
relations
are
to
correspond
exactly
to
consequences
in
the
theory
paraphrasing
einstein
experience
level
without
underlying
theory
levels
and
is
a
disconnected
set
of
observations
and
theory
without
observable
verification
gives
no
practical
knowledge
it
is
remarkable
that
a
theoretician
as
einstein
was
would
assert
that
theory
is
subservient
to
practice
and
that
its
role
is
to
help
us
understand
practice
and
it
provide
a
framework
for
organizing
our
observations
however
since
not
all
theory
helps
to
frame
our
disciplines
this
paper
separates
theory
into
two
levels
at
least
placing
the
is
discipline
the
various
classic
disciplines
are
distributed
differently
over
the
levels
in
the
abstraction
dimension
consider
three
examples
philosophy
is
mostly
rationale
and
the
discipline
concentrates
at
the
upper
levels
engineering
is
mostly
practice
and
the
various
engineering
disciplines
concentrate
in
the
central
levels
mathematics
while
shown
as
an
upright
rectangle
in
figure
is
the
foundation
of
the
sciences
and
as
such
this
discipline
concentrates
in
the
lower
levels
in
this
paper
depth
is
a
relative
term
defined
in
the
abstraction
dimension
depth
is
not
the
absolute
location
of
a
disciplines
center
of
gravity
along
this
dimension
but
is
instead
the
number
of
levels
that
receive
significant
coverage
in
a
given
discipline
by
this
definition
philosophy
engineering
and
mathematics
are
not
very
deep
disciplines
examples
of
deep
disciplines
are
music
and
most
of
the
social
sciences
physics
which
fully
engages
all
six
levels
of
abstraction
is
perhaps
the
deepest
of
all
the
academic
disciplines
the
objective
of
this
paper
is
to
propose
how
our
new
emerging
discipline
fits
into
the
space
of
human
knowledge
with
the
other
more
established
academic
disciplines
our
broadly
defined
information
science
discipline
must
be
made
to
fit
in
horizontally
and
vertically
the
is
disciplines
place
in
the
total
space
of
human
knowledge
has
width
and
depth
as
illustrated
in
figure
we
determine
our
depth
by
identifying
how
our
discipline
distributes
itself
across
the
vertical
abstraction
axis
and
identifying
our
content
in
each
level
we
determine
our
width
by
specifying
the
location
of
is
center
of
gravity
on
the
horizontal
discipline
axis
identifying
which
disciplines
are
our
neighbors
and
identifying
how
closely
our
discipline
butts
up
against
these
neighbors
unfortunately
its
not
so
simple
perhaps
some
day
it
will
be
when
our
discipline
becomes
more
mature
but
now
these
tasks
are
complicated
because
the
disciplines
we
identify
as
our
neighbors
are
different
at
different
levels
of
abstraction
and
the
distribution
across
the
abstraction
dimension
is
different
in
our
different
subdisciplines
section
begins
to
discuss
the
issues
and
begs
for
much
more
followup
how
deep
and
how
wide
this
section
uses
the
following
procedure
identify
is
significant
subdisciplines
specify
the
is
disciplines
levels
of
abstraction
and
how
much
content
depicted
as
the
levels
thickness
we
have
in
each
level
identify
the
neighboring
disciplines
for
each
level
and
recommend
the
width
of
each
level
the
is
subdisciplines
like
everything
else
in
this
paper
this
topic
requires
a
lot
of
discussion
and
the
proposal
here
may
even
be
a
little
contentious
but
for
our
purposes
this
paper
assumes
that
information
science
is
a
superdiscipline
see
section
comprised
of
the
following
six
subdisciplines
librarianship
information
organization
information
management
information
systems
telecommunications
information
security
we
make
no
attempt
here
to
define
or
differentiate
these
that
is
an
important
but
separable
discussion
the
point
here
is
not
that
we
agree
that
information
science
has
these
exact
six
subdisciplines
but
simply
that
we
acknowledge
that
is
has
several
subdisciplines
and
they
are
something
like
these
six
question
is
this
the
complete
list
of
is
subdisciplines
figure
s
vertical
axis
shows
the
six
proposed
levels
of
abstraction
however
figure
s
horizontal
axis
is
a
microscopic
view
of
the
disciplines
of
human
knowledge
illustrating
the
six
subdisciplines
of
our
information
science
superdiscipline
the
figure
serves
to
frame
the
discussion
that
follows
we
will
not
discuss
all
cells
now
but
eventually
we
must
how
deep
the
previous
section
described
and
defined
six
levels
of
abstracttion
so
first
we
examine
how
the
is
superdiscipline
might
distribute
across
these
six
levels
while
were
at
it
lets
also
discuss
how
much
relevant
knowledge
as
depicted
by
the
thickness
of
each
horizontal
band
in
figure
we
have
at
each
level
rationale
our
librarianship
students
typically
understand
our
justification
better
than
those
in
is
other
subdisciplines
we
dont
have
very
much
here
but
all
of
our
students
should
understand
enough
ethics
to
resonate
with
the
digital
divide
and
they
should
understand
how
information
fits
into
maslows
hierarchy
of
human
needs
framework
much
of
the
framework
that
organizes
our
discipline
is
found
in
a
course
commonly
called
information
retrieval
we
need
to
develop
this
framework
better
and
ensure
its
exposure
to
students
in
all
our
subdisciplines
but
we
have
a
good
start
practice
each
of
the
subdisciplines
described
above
focuses
on
the
practical
aspects
of
its
corresponding
profession
since
the
ischools
identify
themselves
as
professional
schools
this
is
appropriate
and
it
is
our
strength
is
various
subdisciplines
are
appropriately
separated
in
this
level
optimization
our
discipline
has
little
to
offer
at
this
level
but
its
included
in
this
list
because
information
scientists
must
develop
this
if
we
are
going
to
be
taken
seriously
by
the
other
disciplines
while
we
can
optimize
some
things
in
telecom
the
other
subdisciplines
must
develop
theory
by
which
to
compare
two
information
systems
and
determine
which
one
is
better
whatever
that
means
or
is
will
forever
be
denigrated
by
our
sister
disciplines
implementation
our
information
systems
are
built
out
of
programs
and
electronic
hardware
we
have
little
to
offer
that
is
exclusively
our
own
but
thats
changing
as
the
www
html
hypertext
and
other
implementation
details
are
perceived
moreandmore
as
the
purview
of
is
and
not
cs
our
various
subdisciplines
cover
this
material
differently
if
at
all
depending
on
entrance
requirements
and
students
skills
fundamentals
our
only
true
fundamental
concept
is
shannons
definition
of
information
but
very
few
of
us
teach
it
and
few
of
our
students
have
the
math
skills
to
understand
it
nor
the
sophistication
to
appreciate
it
so
the
amount
of
is
at
this
lowest
level
is
slimtonone
question
are
there
other
contributions
in
levels
and
since
most
of
is
content
lies
in
layers
and
the
is
discipline
is
quite
thin
and
will
remain
so
unless
we
develop
levels
and
and
try
to
teach
level
how
wide
now
lets
examine
where
the
various
levels
of
our
various
subdisciplines
fit
along
the
horizontal
axis
of
human
knowledge
well
do
this
do
identifying
the
neighboring
disciplines
at
each
level
this
discussion
is
very
incomplete
it
presents
only
a
small
sample
from
the
cells
defined
in
figure
rationale
our
neighboring
disciplines
are
philosophy
when
we
discuss
ethics
and
sociology
when
we
discuss
maslows
needs
what
we
typically
present
is
mostly
borrowed
from
these
neighbors
but
we
should
develop
it
further
and
we
should
consider
presenting
this
material
to
students
in
all
our
subdisciplines
framework
illustrating
the
diversity
of
our
discipline
this
levels
many
neighbors
include
psychology
for
cognition
business
for
managing
information
organizations
and
projects
and
for
understanding
applications
in
all
organizations
law

subdiscipline
used
to
butt
up
against

subdiscipline
and
our
information
systems
and

subdisciplines
butt
up
against
computer

we
have
succeeded
recently
at
carving
out
more
of
our
own
space
at
this
level
optimization
most
of
what
we
do
at
this
level
is
borrowed
from
computer
science
although
telecom
also
borrows
heavily
from
electrical
engineering
for
optimizable
concepts
like
bandwidth
and
signaltonoise
ratio
information
science
is
sadly
lacking
at
this
level
and
as
stated
earlier
information
scientists
must
develop
this
level
if
we
want
to
be
taken
seriously
implementation
the
neighboring
disciplines
are
computer
science
for
implementing
programs
and
electrical
engineering
for
implementing
information
systems
fundamentals
shannons
definition
of
information
is
borrowed
from
electrical
engineering
but
we
should
cast
it
in
a
more
general
way
since
it
is
our
only
fundamental
we
should
consider
teaching
it
in
all
our
subdisciplines
even
if
it
means
sufficiently
developing
our
students
math
skills
so
they
can
understand
it
while
the
discussion
above
identifies
is
many
neighboring
disciplines
it
does
not
discuss
the
boundary
between
is
and
its
neighbors
that
discussion
while
it
logically
follows
directly
is
so
relevant
to
is
curriculum
design
that
this
paper
separates
it
into
a
separate
and
concluding
section
question
not
so
much
a
question
but
we
must
fill
in
details
from
all
cells
in
figure
variations
figure
below
summarizes
much
of
this
sections
discussion
again
its
not
meant
to
be
the
final
word
on
this
topic
but
it
attempts
to
illustrate
the
profiles
of
two
of
our
subdisciplines
and
how
we
might
structure
the
is
superdiscipline
if
we
offered
it
as
three
different
academic
degrees
where
do
we
go
from
here
filling
the
holes
having
described
our
near
neighbors
and
the
body
of
knowledge
we
have
in
common
with
them
lets
discuss
now
how
closely
we
should
butt
up
against
these
neighbors
at
each
level
of
abstraction
we
observe
gaps
or
holes
in
the
spaces
between
the
idiscipline
and
its
neighbors
these
holes
represent
areas
of
human
knowledge
that
are
typically
excluded
from
the
academic
disciplines
at
most
universities
many
professionals
who
graduated
from
our
programs
have
filled
these
holes
themselves
perhaps
poorly
by
their
own
cleverness
perhaps
we
could
do
a
better
job
of
preparing
them
for
their
professions
by
filling
these
holes
for
them
while
they
are
our
students
for
example
those
telecom
program
chairs
who
are
trying
to
unify
the
nations
telecom
curriculum
struggle
with
what
we
call
the
physical
layer
how
well
should
a
telecom
professional
understand
physicallayer
concepts
like
bandwidth
noise
filters
reflections
attenuation
and
other
forms
of
signal
distortion
how
well
should
they
understand
how
signals
propagate
through
wires
fibers
and
freespace
many
of
us
reside
in
universities
that
also
have
electrical
engineering
departments
where
this
material
is
taught
but
in
a
general
way
that
also
applies
to
electrical
circuits
power
systems
control
systems
and
other
subdisciplines
of
ee
furthermore
when
the
ees
teach
this
material
they
do
it
in
a
mathematical
presentation
that
many
telecom
students
struggle
with
in
fact
the
eets
split
off
from
the
ees
over
this
issue
telecom
students
dont
need
that
generality
or
mathematical
presentation
and
ee
students
dont
need
the
specific
details
in
the
telecom
application
so
there
is
no
perfect
course
the
hole
in
figure
unless
we
in
telecom
teach
it
ourselves
there
are
many
other
examples
only
a
few
are
listed
below
material
on
information
ethics
and
on
the
human
need
for
information
could
be
part
of
the
is
superdiscipline
not
left
for
one
of
its
subdisciplines
and
not
left
for
the
philosophy
or
sociology
disciplines
to
offer
many
universities
dont
offer
a
course
on
human
cognition
in
is
nor
in
psych
our
students
need
to
know
how
the
human
component
performs
as
part
of
an
information
system
and
they
would
be
better
served
by
an
is
approach
to
cognition
while
the
business
schools
at
our
respective
universities
might
offer
courses
on
mis
organizational
behavior
including
the
impact
of
technology
on
organizations
and
project
management
these
are
typically
offered
too
generally
our
students
need
to
understand
the
impact
of
information
and
not
all
technologies
on
organizations
and
they
need
to
learn
how
to
manage
projects
in
their
subdisciplines
we
have
similar
issues
with
the
law
school
and
political
science
department
for
course
material
on
policy
intellectual
property
law
and
egovernment
our
problem
with
the
computer
science
department
is
even
worse
because
the
typical
cs
course
on
databases
and
data
structures
usually
entails
far
more
programming
assignments
than
our
students
need
this
list
isnt
complete
without
saying
one
more
time
that
information
scientists
must
develop
a
theory
that
supports
information
systems
optimization
and
we
should
consider
teaching
shannons
definition
of
iinformation
in
all
our
subdisciplines
even
if
it
means
sufficiently
developing
our
students
math
skills
so
they
can
understand
it
this
paper
argues
that
the
ischools
should
strive
to
fill
these
holes
but
there
are
two
at
least
problems
most
is
faculty
are
very
eclectic
but
offering
this
list
of
courses
will
require
even
greater
diversity
and
breadth
we
get
into
the
very
difficult
area
of
university
economics
and
the
pressure
most
of
our
universities
are
putting
on
us
to
jointlist
more
courses
question
again
not
really
a
question
but
we
should
compile
a
more
complete
list
of
the
other
holes
we
need
to
consider
filling
defining
the
superdiscipline
our
overall
superdiscipline
should
be
greater
than
the
intersection
of
the
academic
content
covered
by
these
six
subdisciplines
but
small
than
their
union
it
should
be
some
reasonable
selection
of
the
best
parts
from
these
six
subdisciplines
then
each
of
these
subdisciplines
would
be
a
specialization
within
this
superdiscipline
when
we
look
at
the
other
schools
and
colleges
at
our
respecttive
universities
we
see
several
models
for
how
superdisciplines
and
subdisciplines
interoperate
we
need
to
consider
which
of
these
models
is
appropriate
for
us
in
arts
and
sciences
and
in
engineering
about
half
the
courses
any
student
takes
are
common
across
all
departments
and
about
half
are
specific
to
a
department
in
most
of
the
constituent
departments
about
threefourths
of
what
a
student
takes
is
common
and
students
may
specialize
in
their
final
one
or
two
semesters
in
other
schools
like
business
the
curriculum
is
more
isolated
from
the
other
disciplines
they
may
object
to
this
characterization
but
for
example
while
math
science
and
engineering
students
all
take
the
same
calculus
course
business
students
have
their
own
the
ischools
can
adopt
one
of
these
models
this
isnt
much
of
an
issue
for
an
ischool
that
offers
only
one
or
two
of
the
six
identified
subdisciplines
but
if
an
ischool
claims
to
cover
the
entire
spectrum
or
wishes
to
evolve
in
that
direction
it
might
organize
its
curriculum
as
a
common
superdiscipline
with
specializations
or
as
separate
subdisciplines
with
a
small
common
core
or
as
something
in
between
in
sis
at
pitt
we
offer
these
six
subdisciplines
but
they
have
been
siloed
for
too
long
we
are
developing
a
common
introductory
course
to
be
offered
to
all
students
next
fall
semester
and
we
are
considering
a
common
capstone
course
question
what
is
the
right
architecture
for
the
information
science
superdiscipline
