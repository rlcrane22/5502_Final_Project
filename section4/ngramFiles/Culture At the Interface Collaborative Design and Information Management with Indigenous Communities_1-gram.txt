digital

provide

platform
for

indigenous
and
other
subaltern
cultural
perspectives
on
access
authority
and
accountability
in
relation
to
cultural
materials
and

are
often
marginalized
in
dominant
narratives
about
the
possibilities
of
digital

mainstream
notions
of

and

systems
while
digital
technologies
have
much
to
offer
to
museums
and
other
archival
institutions
and
their
many
publics
their
use
needs
to
call
in
to
question
the
viability
of
universal
logics
of
search
and
access
since
the
mid
s
museums
archives
libraries
and
especially
land
grant
universities
in
the
united
states
have
recognized
the
need
to
direct
their
energies
towards
outreach
to
the
indigenous
communities
whose
materials
they
hold
many
archives
have
signed
memorandums
of
understanding
mous
with
indigenous
communities
promising
access
and
support
in
retrieving
materials
digital
technologies
have
allowed
archives
to
produce
online
databases
and
expand
their
physical
catalogs
with
digital
repositories
at
the
same
time
archival
mandates
to
preserve
information
intersect
with
the
capabilities
of
digital
technologies
to
distribute
information
over
networks
in
the
context
of
information
freedom
rhetoric
and
appeals
for

archives
have
found
themselves
at
the
center
of
information
management
debates
and
strategies
for
new
models
for
information
indexing
and
distribution
museums
and
archives
now
enlivened
by
the
possibilities
afforded
by
digital
technologies
are
at
a
crossroads
in
dealing
with
emergent
information
management
systems
and
the
cultural
ethical
and
legal
commitments
they
have
to
their
multiple
stakeholders
making
their
materials
open
on
the
one
hand
and
working
with
divergent
protocols
for
access
and
distribution
on
the
other
in
addition
physical
distances
educational
and
linguistic
barriers
and
high
levels
of
poverty
have
all
made
traditional
archives
unapproachable
places
for
indigenous
communities
whose
cultural
materials
and
institutional
histories
are
preserved
within
them
however
in
the
last
ten
years
there
has
been
a
groundswell
of
activity
lead
by
local
indigenous
communities
in
conversation
with
museums
archives
and
technologists
to
incorporate
indigenous
cultural
protocols
into
the
parameters
of
archival
sensibilities
design
and
infrastructure
projects
around
the
world
are
seeking
to
integrate
indigenous
protocols
into
their
informatics
the
papers
in
this
panel
focus
on
collaborative
efforts
between
museums
archives
and
local
indigenous
communities
in
australia
and
native
north
america
to
create
digital
archival
systems
informed
by
indigenous
practices
and
protocols
the
panel
members
come
from
diverse
academic
and
technological
backgrounds
representing
the
fine
arts
humanities
and
social
sciences
their
work
is
informed
by
interdisciplinary
concerns
shaping
scholars
understandings
of
the
practical
uses
of
digital
technologies
for
underrepresented
groups
and
the
collaborative
ways
in
which
technology
can
be
leveraged
in
service
of
cultural
differences
the
first
paper
co
presented
by
the
principal
investigator
and
software
designer
based
on
ten
years
of
collaborative
work
with
warumungu
community
members
in
australias
northern
territory
examines
the
production
of
an
indigenous
community
digital
archive
and
its
internal
search
functionality
the
mukurtu

archive
installed
in
the
community
in

leverages
warumungu
protocols
for
the
reproduction
distribution
and
access
to
cultural
materials
and
their
associated
knowledge
within
the
design
and
structure
of
the
archive
a
series
of
restrictions
and
sharing
protocols
designated
by
the
warumungu
communitydrives
the
searching
sorting
and
sharing
of
all
materials
in
the
system
the
archive
thus
challenges
dominant
narratives
of
openness
and
accessibility
in
relation
to
intangible
cultural
materials
and
acts
as
a
practical
solution
to
issues
of
preservation
access
and
distribution
that
face
indigenous
people
globally
the
second
paper
describes
a
nsffunded
initiative
which
involves
a
direct
partnership
with
the
zuni
nation
of
new
mexico
and
the
cambridge
uk
digital
museum
initiative
this
partnership
involves
the
study
of
how
digital
objects
of
excavated
cultural
materials
can
become
the
bases
for
indigenous
engagement
and
stimulate
the
release
of
indigenous
and
crosscultural
voices
into
the
larger
world
of
how
digital
systems
are
developed
it
questions
the
assumptions
that
all
information
is
free
and
should
be
widely
disseminated
without
a
sense
of
bounds
authorship
or
culturallyspecific
forms
of
reception
moreover
it
questions
the
preexisting
classification
systems
for
digital
libraries
and
museums
and
argues
for
a
more
participatory
model
finally
it
investigates
the
possibilities
of
creating
information
commonses
based
around
diverse
voices
that
indigenize
processes
of
tagging
blogging
and
commenting
