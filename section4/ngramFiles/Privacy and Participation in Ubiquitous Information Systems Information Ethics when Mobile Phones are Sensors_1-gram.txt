ubiquitious
information
systems
hold
increasing
promise
for
widespread
participation
in
data
collection
and
dissemination
common
and
abundant
devices
such
as
mobile
phones
can
sense
and
record
data
such
as
location
sound
and
images
these
systems
can
facilitate
community
participation
in
basic
and
applied
research
improvement
of
quality
of
life
social
change
selfreflection
and

but
the
design
and

of
these
tools
also
pose
new

the

background
previous
research
has
proposed
a
variety
of
technical
approaches
to
privacy
protection
in
a
world
of
increasing
information

these
include
encryption
privacyenhancing
technologies
pets
and
statistical
anonymization

burkert
while
these
approaches
to
privacy
protection
are
important
in
humanembedded

systems
we
argue
that
privacy
requirements
for
networks
of
sensitive
personal
data
extend
beyond
such
measures
