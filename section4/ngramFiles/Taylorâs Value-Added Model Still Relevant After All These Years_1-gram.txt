introduction
this
paper
is
an
effort
to
reacquaint
the
information
field
with
the
work
of
one
of
its
pioneers
robert
s
taylor
and
his
valueadded
model
taylors
valueadded
model
was
a
broad
and
ambitious
effort
to
provide
a
unified
framework
for
focusing
on
user
needs
and
preferences
in
evaluating
and
designing
information
systems
although
developed
in
the
early
s
before
the
widespread
adoption
of
the
microcomputer
and
wellbefore
the
internet
and
web
based
technologies
that
have
so
changed
our
livesthe
model
holds
up
remarkably
well
in
terms
of
explaining
why
various
systems
and
systems
attributes
are
useful
and
desirable
or
not
the
valueadded
model
seeks
to
explain
what
users
want
why
they
want
them
and
how
systems
are
able
to
meet
or
not
meet
those
needs
what
do
users
want
from
information
systems
that
would
enable
them
to
perform
better
however
better
performance
is
defined
in
their
context
taylor
p
this
paper
updates
taylors
work
in
light
of
dramatic
developments
over
the
past
years
and
demonstrates
how
the
model
remains
highly
applicable
and
valuable
in
both
research
and
practical
contexts
across
the
interests
of
ischools
robert
bob
taylor
is
wellknown
for
his
contributions
to
library
and
information
science
his
paper
question
negotiation
and
the
reference
process
taylor
was
one
of
the
first
works
to
emphasize
a
user
and
information
perspective
it
remains
one
of
the
most
cited
works
in
the
history
of
library
and
information
science
taylor
was
also
a
visionary
and
pioneer
in
the
movement
that
led
to
the
formation
of
information
schools
in
the
mids
he
assumed
the
deanship
at
syracuse
changed
the
name
to
the
school
of
information
studies
and
launched
their
doctoral
program
and
later
the
masters
in
information
resources
management
taylor
finished
his
career
with
his
work
on
the
valueadded
model
the
goals
of
this
paper
are
to
reintroduce
the
field
to
taylors
model
to
suggest
revisions
to
the
model
based
on
our
experience
and
our
interactions
with
information
professionals
and
graduate
students
to
demonstrate
the
widespread
applicability
of
the
modified
model
in
current
contexts
to
better
understanding
users
information
systems
as
well
as
the
scope
of
the
information
field
to
offer
recommendations
for
further
work
to
develop
and
use
the
modified
model
we
state
this
from
personal
experience
in
using
taylors
model
in
formal
presentations
and
graduate
courses
for
example

paper
eisenbergdirks
p
the
taylor
model
both
the
original
and
our
proposed
modified
model
helps
explain
the
motivation
of
users
why
certain
systems
and
systems

perform
so
well
in
meeting
users
needs
or
not
e

indeed
we
posit
that
taylors
model
can
and
should
help
to
guide
systems
design
user
studies
marketing
and
entrepreneurship
in
information
management
this
last
area
may
be
its
most
compelling
use
entrepreneurs
seeking
to
determine
new
products
and
services
can
utilize
this
updated
taylor
model
as
a
checklist
for
improving
enhancing
or
developing
new
and
more
compelling
information
products
and
services
in
this
paper
we
offer
the
modified
taylor
valueadded
model
as
a
means
to
better
understand
and
explain
successful
entrepreneurship
and
innovation
the
paper
closes
with
an
outline
for
further
development
application
and
research
of
the
taylor
model
the
ischool
community
continues
to
seek
ways
of
explaining
to
wider
audiences
what
it
is
that
we
do
and
why
it
is
important
we
believe
that
in
reacquainting
the
field
with
an
evolvedupdated
view
of
taylors
seminal
work
a
functional
model
will
greatly
facilitate
this
important
effort
taylors
valueadded
model
as
noted
above
the
purpose
of
the
valueadded
model
was
to
provide
a
framework
for
considering
information
and
systems
from
a
user
perspective
underlying
the
model
are
the
three
foundation
elements
of
the
information
fieldpeople
information
and

people
the
main
focus
is
on
the
user
systems
exist
to
meet
the
information
needs
of
users
additionally
people
can
be
viewed
as
part
of
the
system
information
there
is
a
hierarchy
of
information
the
information
spectrum
as
value
is
added
we
move
up
the
spectrum
from
data
to
information
to
knowledge
to
action
systems
the
purpose
of
an
information
system
is
to
add
value
to
better
meet
user
needs
various
systems
processes
add
value
in
order
to
meet
user
needs
taylor
emphasized
that
information
systems
are
all
about
meeting
the
needs
of
users
systems
and
the
underlying
system
processes
algorithms
and
features
exist
to
add
value
in
order
to
meet
those
needs
the
valueadded
model
provides
an
organized
framework
for
considering
system
processes
that
add
value
in

to
meet
user
needs

consider

and
a

student
if
both
were
using
information
systems
to
seek

about

the

might
rate

the
relative

or
another
criteria

the

these
are
the
processes
features
and
elements
of
the

that
add
to
the

identified
in

which
in
turn
meet
the

the

may
contribute
to
the
values

of

comprehensiveness
currency
reliability
and
validity
which
then
combine
to
address
the
user
criterion
of
quality
as
pointed
out
in
the
introduction
this
model
was
developed
well
before
many
of
the
technological
changes
that
have
fundamentally
altered
human
society
e
g
the
personal
computer
cell
phones
the
internet
the
world
wide
web
however
the
model
is
robust
and
highly
useful
in
explaining
why
these
and
other
technological
innovations
are
adopted
and
valued
by
individuals
and
organizations
taylor
explains
the
intricacies
of
the
model
and
defines
various
terms
in
chapter
of
his
book
he
also
provides
a
table
of
definitions
of
his
identified
valuesadded
rather
than
replicate
taylors
elaboration
here
this
paper
first
presents
suggested
modifications
that
clarify
and
expand
the
original
valueadded
model
this
is
followed
by
an
abbreviated
discussion
of
user
criteria
values
added
and
system
processes
within
the
context
of
a
suggested
modified
valueadded
model
eisenbergdirks
modifications
to
taylors
valueadded
model
the
core
of
taylors
model
is
represented
in
figure
from
his
book
reproduced
above
as
figure
our
suggested
modifications
relate
to
this
figure
and
are
presented
below
in
figure
while
we
have
shared
these
modifications
previously
with
various
audiences
through
presentations
this
is
the
first
recorded
paper
outlining
our
thoughts
therefore
we
see
these
as
formative
or
proposed
modifications
and
we
expect
that
feedback
from
readers
as
well
as
from
our
fieldbased
investigations
will
help
us
to
fashion
a
more
complete
and
conclusive
modified
value
added
model
in
addition
we
recognize
the
desirability
of
identifying
analyzing
and
comparing
frameworks
and
models
of
fundamental
concepts
of
information
systems
services
and
behaviors
e
g
relevance
credibility
use
we
expect
that
this
too
will
lead
to
adjustments
in
specific
elements
included
in
the
modified
model
for
example
we
anticipate
that
advances
in
the
application
of
semantic
technology
could
have
major
implications
in
the
user
criteria
of
ease
of
use
and

eisenbergdirks
p
our
first
recommended
changes
to
taylors
original
model
relate
to
the
overarching
terminology
used
taylor
presents
a
three
part
view
as
the
basis
for
the
model
user
interface
and
system
the
user
part
focus
on
the
problems
which
establish
the
criteria
of
choice
the
interface
is
a
negotiating
space
between
the
user
and
the
system
and
according
to
taylor
displays
the
values
added
by
the
system
to
assist
the
user
in
making
choices
the
system
includes
the
specific
processes
that
add
specific
values
taylor
p
these
labels
can
be
difficult
in
explaining
and
applying
the
model
partially
because
of
using
the
word
values
and
term
valueadded
in
slightly
different
ways
in
the
same
table
we
therefore
offer
a
simplified
labeling
of
the
three
part
view
user
criteria
valuesadded
system
process
instead
of
user
criteria
of
choice
its
more
direct
to
simply
state
user
criteria
for
column
two
valuesadded
encompasses
much
more
than
just
the
interface
the
term
valuesadded
is
still
consistent
with
taylors
description
of
these
being
the
values
added
by
the
system
which
aid
customers
in
matching
their
needs
taylor
p
lastly
in
his
text
taylor
refers
to
valueadded
processes
and
system
processes
interchangeably
system
processes
is
preferred
here
as
it
avoids
confusion
with
the
valuesadded
from
column
two
the
use
these
terms
helps
to
emphasize
the
relationships
across
the
columns
of
the
model
that
is
various
system
processes
our
second
group
of
modifications
involves
the
more
specific
elements
of
the
model
in
each
of
the
three
columns
again
while
the
original
valueadded
model
is
still
useful
for
describing
and
analyzing
current
user
and
system
interactions
developments
over
the
past
twenty
years
point
to
additional
criteria
and
related
values
added
taylor
himself
notes
that
his
criteria
are
broken
into
six
categories
for
convenience
sake
and
are
not
graven
in
stone
taylor
p
we
agree
with
his
statement
that
they
are
a
useful
way
of
organizing
the
values
that
are
added
but
we
offer
a
reformulation
of
the
last
two
criteria
timesaving
and
costsaving
under
the
broader
heading
of
performance
we
also
propose
an
additional
criterion
pleasing
which
relates
to
the
values
of
aesthetics
entertaining
reward
and
engaging
taylor
sought
to
derive
his
criteria
and
values
added
from
the
literature
but
found
it
equally
important
to
learn
from
professional
experience
he
found
few
studies
concerned
directly
with
values
and
user
benefits
so
he
drew
on
various
formal
and
informal
sources
at
this
point
in
time
our
suggested
modifications
in
criteria
values
added
and
system
processes
derive
from
personal
reflection
and
fieldbased
experience
we
recognize
the
importance
of
comparing
and
testing
the
modified
model
in
relation
to
the
literature
as
well
as
through
systematic
investigations
turning
to
column
two
now
labeled
simply
values
added
taylors
original
list
is
both
consolidated
and
expanded
here
are
some
examples
for
user
criterion
ease
of
use
taylor
offers
mediation
and
orientation
as
two
different
ways
of
interfacing
the
modified
model
focuses
on
each
more
separately
with
the
value
of
mediation
referring
to
assistancehelp
and
orientation
for
user
familiarity
or
navigation
with
the
system
the
modified
model
also
recognizes
that
the
value
of
accessibility
is
not
just
limited
to
physical
but
virtual
as
well
eisenbergdirks
p
for
noise
reduction
the
revised
model
seeks
to
break
out
three
values
added
nested
within
the
term
access
the
modified
model
emphasizes
item
identification
classification
and
summarization
as
separate
values
added
while
also
offering
referral
and
novelty
as
other
values
added
to
include
cost
saving
and
time
saving
were
criteria
only
minimally
developed
in
taylors
original
conceptualization
cost
saving
was
also
listed
as
both
a
criterion
and
a
value
in
the
modified
model
both
of
these
are
now
considered
as
values
related
to
the
broader
criterion
of
performance
we
expect
further
development
of
this
important
criterion
in
terms
of
associated
values
and
system
processes
security
privacy
and
safety
are
three
identified
values
added
that
are
increasingly
important
security
and
safety
were
determined
to
best
relate
to
the
newly
combined
user
criterion
of
performance
while
privacy
seemed
increasingly
associated
with
userdriven
desires
and
therefore
best
associated
to
adaptability
as
noted
above
pleasing
is
a
totally
new
user
criterion
with
associated
values
added
of
aesthetics
entertaining
rewarding
and
engaging
in
certain
instances
the
values
identified
in
values
added
can
be
applied
to
different
user
criteria
for
example
the
value
simplicity
relates
to
both
ease
of
use
and
adaptability
in
addition
the
terms
relevance
and
usefulness
are
broad
multidimensional
concepts
of
information
and
relate
to
many
of
the
user
criteria
relevance
and
usefulness
may
be
viewed
as
infused
across
the
entire
modified
valueadded
model
in
the
book
taylor
included
a
table
of
definitions
of
values
added
see
page
for
all
of
the
values
included
in
the
middle
column
we
hope
to
be
able
to
do
the
same
in
a
subsequent
paper
the
third
column
system
processes
provides
examples
of
the
capabilities
approaches
and
features
of
systems
that
might
be
used
to
add
the
values
noted
in
column
to
meet
the
criteria
of
users
column
systems
processes
are
numerous
and
continually
being
developed
taylors
original
model
only
includes
a
small
number
of
system
processes
we
attempted
to
identify
more
however
even
these
are
only
representative
of
abundant
options
for
example
although
likely
inferred
in
taylors
original
work
the
concept
of
navigating
connections
via
electronic
links
labeled
as
the
system
process
hyperlinking
in
the
modified
model
is
now
obvious
and
a
critical
concept
for
nearly
all
information
systems
hyperlinking
was
conceived
by
computer
scientist
ted
nelson
in
the
s
but
it
didnt
gain
widespread
use
until
the
development
of
the
world
wide
web
by
tim
bernerslee
decades
later
still
it
is
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
this
relatively
recentlyimplemented
system
processhyperlinking
is
one
of
the
most
significant
of
all
system
processes
because
it
is
the
foundation
of
the
world
wide
web
our
most
pervasive
and
now
essential
information
system
the
modified
valueadded
model
helps
to
explain
why
this
is
so
hyperlinking
is
a
system
process
that
relates
to
the
values
added
of
item
identification
referral
precision
and
selectivity
these
values
in
turn
help
to
meet
the
user
criteria
of
noise
reduction
this
may
seem
strange
at
first
because
the
world
wide
web
is
often
criticized
as
noisy
and
contributing
to
information
overload
however
thats
not
due
to
hyperlinking
in
fact
hyperlinking
helps
users
eisenbergdirks
p
to
sift
through
the
noise
by
identifying
items
of
interest
by
referral
to
precise
websites
or
sections
of
websites
or
by
allowing
creation
of
selected
links
by
website
or
content
creators
the
usefulness
of
other
information
systems
are
similarly
explained
by
the
model
by
making
the
connection
to
related
values
added
in
order
to
meet
identified
user
criteria
consider
cell
phones
as
an
information
system
for
some
people
when
choosing
a
phone
its
the
pleasing
criteria
that
are
most
important
for
these
users
its
important
to
emphasize
the
values
added
of
aesthetics
entertaining
or
stimulating
these
values
are
added
by
the
systems
processes
of
design
and
interactivity
for
other
users
its
ease
of
use
thats
crucial
and
they
are
looking
for
a
cell
phone
that
is
simple
accessible
and
easy
to
navigate
through
functions
i
e
orientation
system
processes
of
highlighting
formatting
and
simplifying
help
to
address
these
values
and
criteria
for
a
final
example
we
return
to
the
situation
and
needs
of
the
senior
nasa
scientist
and
a
th
grade
student
noted
earlier
in
this
paper
both
were
seeking
information
about
climate
change
in
the
arctic
for
the
scientist
it
is
likely
to
be
all
about
quality
of
information
and
the
values
that
meet
the
quality
criterion
are
accuracy
currency
comprehensiveness
authority
and
reliability
system
processed
that
address
these
values
include
quality
control
in
research
studies
editing
and
updating
of
papers
and
reports
analyzing
data
sets
and
selecting
valid
and
reliable
information
from
authoritative
sources
but
the
th
grade
student
has
different
needs
that
might
relate
to
ease
of
use
and
also
pleasing
system
processes
of
formatting
highlighting
and
simplifying
may
add
values
of
simplicity
accessibility
and
simplicity
for
ease
of
use
for
pleasing
there
are
processes
that
provide
interactivity
and
reinforcement
finally
although
we
anticipate
the
modified
valueadded
model
to
evolve
in
time
we
feel
that
there
are
varying
degrees
to
which
each
column
may
or
may
not
change
for
example
the
user
criteria
column
seems
sufficient
and
complete
and
unlikely
to
change
substantively
we
made
only
minor
modifications
to
the
original
concepts
established
by
taylorcombining
cost
effective
and
time
saving
into
performance
and
adding
the
new
criterion
pleasing
the
valueadded
column
is
somewhat
definitive
but
certainly
not
comprehensive
we
expect
this
column
will
require
some
adjustment
and
expansion
the
most
frequent
changes
will
take
place
in
the
system
processes
column
as
with
taylor
this
column
is
intended
to
be
representative
and
to
change
as
new
system
processes
and
capabilities
emerge
applying
the
modified
valueadded
model
the
sections
above
presented
taylors
original
model
and
explained
our
proposed
modifications
we
also
attempted
to
demonstrate
how
the
model
can
be
used
to
explain
how
different
information
systems
can
add
value
in
order
to
meet
user
needs
in
our
view
the
sustained
relevance
of
taylors
valueadded
work
is
impressive
his
concepts
and
framework
are
as
applicable
and
useful
as
they
were
twenty
years
ago
this
section
offers
thoughts
as
to
how
the
modified
valueadded
model
is
applicable
and
valuable
in
practical
and
educational
contexts
practical
applications
the
role
of
information
professionals
has
evolved
dramatically
over
the
past
plus
years
in
the
everquickening
transition
from
the
information
fields
past
e
g
punch
and
catalog
cards
to
the
future
e
g
xml
and
metadata
the
information
manager
is
now
thrust
into
the
forefront
of
a
multibillion
dollar
information
technology
industry
librarians
and
other
traditional
information
professionals
are
now
competing
with
major
corporations
and
an
entire
industry
of
eisenbergdirks
p
information
service
and
system
providers
facilitating
access
to
information
this
explosion
of
the
information
role
has
evolved
and
will
continue
to
change
and
in
this
process
information
professionals
can
continue
statusquo
or
can
take
charge
and
proactively
adapt
to
address
the
growing
information
needs
of
endusers
in
this
new
environment
this
global
connected
information
marketplace
with
a
new
level
of
attention
and
scrutiny
it
is
critical
for
the
information
profession
to
take
a
new
approach
the
development
of
information
systems
and
the
provision
of
information
services
in
industry
are
fastpaced
and
everchanging
it
is
an
extremely
aggressive
marketplace
where
competitive
differentiation
and
viable
substitutes
are
apparent
daily
in
this
setting
the
availability
of
a
simple
framework
that
can
be
used
to
brainstorm
and
assess
potential
ideas
is
an
extremely
valuable
resource
using
the
modified
valueadded
model
to
evaluate
and
reevaluate
information
systems
allows
the
information
professional
a
way
to
test
and
improve
services
and
resources
in
terms
of
meeting
users
needs
the
consistent
focused
application
of
this
model
will
result
in
improved
offerings
more
successful
systems
and
tools
resulting
in
higher
productivity
these
types
of
benefits
can
have
impact
on
all
sectors
not
just
private
industry
shifting
from
the
private
sector
it
is
crucial
that
information
professionals
in
the
public
sector
utilize
this
framework
as
a
tool
as
well
whatever
setting
one
is
in
the
new
concept
of
infopreneurship
is
taking
on
greater
significance
for
example
assume
an
aerospace
engineer
is
working
on
a
new
project
for
her
the
most
important
user
criteria
is
quality
an
information
professional
seeking
to
assist
this
user
could
consider
the
values
options
noted
in
the
middle
column
e
g
accuracy
comprehensiveness
currency
reliability
etc
and
begin
to
think
about
how
to
add
these
values
given
the
information
set
or
the
systems
available
if
the
available
systems
are
not
able
to
meet
the
desired
values
other
systems
or
services
can
be
brought
into
play
in
this
way
each
of
the
first
two
columns
of
the
modified
valueadded
model
serve
as
useful
pivots
that
provide
information
professionals
or
managers
a
framework
for
considering
possible
products
services
or
systems
to
use
from
an
industry
perspective
the
modified
valueadded
model
can
be
applied
in
at
least
three
ways
developing
new
systems
tools
if
charged
with
developing
a
whole
new
information
product
or
information
service
from
scratch
the
modified
valueadded
model
can
provide
a
thorough
defined
way
of
vetting
potential
ideas
on
top
of
whatever
information
source
you
are
working
with
scenario
two
business
partners
are
considering
the
creation
of
a
brand
new
online
travel
guide
they
can
consider
the
user
criteria
of
quality
and
then
analyze
at
the
different
value
added
options
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
each
value
added
can
be
considered
to
have
a
broad
range
of
choices

etc
note
in
the
above
example
automatic

is
an
important
distinction
between
the
two
fictitious

if
some
cases

is
highquality
because
it
is

whereas
in
other
cases
it
can
be

since
it

in
this

you
can

utilize
this

approach
with
the
intent
of

the
key
is
to
use
the

to
systematically
identify
user

and
preferences
the
values
that
will
meet
those

is
critical
that
we
prepare

for
the

how

as
the

students
benefit

taylors
modified

is
a
prime
example
of
the
sorts
of

that
need
to
be
developed

over
the

in
both
undergraduate

graduatelevel
classes
including
foundations
of
informatics
human
aspects
of
information
systems
and
the
life

we
find
that
the

helps
students
to
move
from
theoretical
understandings
of
the

perspective
to
a

as
a
framework
for
focusing
on

we
attempted
to
demonstrate
how
a

remains
highly
applicable
and
valuable
in
practical
and
educational
contexts
in
terms
of

there
is
considerable
work
to
be
done
in

of
further
developing
and
refining
the
modified

applying
and
testing
the
model
across
situations
and
using
the
model
in
research

to
better
understand
users

in
addition
we
are
particularly
interested
in
studying
innovation
and
entrepreneurship
from
a
valueadded
perspective
lastly
we
hope
to
more
systematically
determining
the
usefulness
and
impact
of
the
model
in
information
school
educational
programs
further
development
and
refinement
of
the
modified
valueadded
model
involves
delving
deeper
in
to
the
literature
to
make
connections
between

in
order
to
facilitate

and
to
publicly

we
also
encourage
others
to
engage
in
followup
studies
and
share
results
with
us
and
through
various
forms
of
publication
our
preference
for
applying
and
testing
the
model
across
situations
involves
fieldbased
research
in
businesses
particularly
information
oriented
startup
companies
we
envision
both

approaches
as
well
as
qualitative
data

related
to

in

of

here
too
we
hope
that
other
researchers
will
consider
using
the
model
in
user
behavior
and
systems
studies
development
and
research
related
to
educational
programs
will
involve
working
with
faculty
and
students
across
information
schools
programs
and
courses
this
paper
is
a
first
effort
to
share
our
thoughts
and
experiences
with
the
broader
information
field
and
education
community
our
hope
is
that
this
paper
will
serve
to
raise
interest
in
using
the
model
in
courses
and
programs
if
there
is
interest
we
would
be
interested
in
forming
an
online
community
interested
in
sharing
ideas
materials
and
approaches
this
might
be
followed
by
