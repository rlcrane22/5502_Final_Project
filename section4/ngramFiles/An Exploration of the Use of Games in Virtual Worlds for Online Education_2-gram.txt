a final

pedagogical objectives
objectives and
and assumptions

students abilities
abilities and
one of
of our
our chief
chief concerns
concerns in
in this
this game

is that
that students
students may
may not
not take
take the
time to
to conduct
conduct rudimentary
rudimentary research
research on
on their
their roles
roles and
and as
as a
a result
could ask
ask us
us for

additional information
further we
we speculated
speculated that
knowing how
how ones
ones role

initially stands
stands on
on a
a bill

might help

assume their

as a
a result
result make
make them
them less

finally if
if one
one opts

to tell

students how
how their
their role

then it
it is
is essential

such that
each role

at the

one of

it is

to apply

learning through
through practice
it is
is clear
clear that
that many
many kids

are highly
highly skilled
at playing

this happens
happens because
because they
they have

which eventually
eventually improves

this type

but it
it is

while this
this could

the things
things that
educators should
should keep
keep in
in mind
mind when
when developing
developing or
or modifying
modifying games
games for

is the
the graduated

these games

the first
first and
and greatest

university faculty
faculty do
do not
not have

formal training

much less
game development
however educators
educators should
should realize

them to
to find
find games

thus have

standards that
that would

be acceptable
acceptable in

however because
because it
it is

necessary to

there is

thus no
no need

to have
have the
the student
student admitted

particular university
university to

it is
is thus
possible that
that in

we could
