      1 it all the time
      1 it advisor what classes
      1 is very much into
      1 is very hard for
      1 is valuable in that
      1 is to differentiate themselves
      1 is the coding itself
      1 is that user spontaneous

      1 issues it just does
      1 issues at an upperundergraduate
      1 is still young and
      1 is something that they
      1 is something that i
      1 is something like an
      1 is related to many
      1 is related to creating
      1 is receiving higher education
      1 is really important because
      1 is really good about
      1 is optional to students
      1 is one of the
      1 isnt something that im
      1 is not very exciting
      1 is not practical for
      1 is not only hard
      1 is noteworthy that students
      1 is no strong theoretical
      1 is no social science
      1 is more interesting more
      1 is more about providing
      1 is limited to some
      1 is limited to an
      1 is learning practical handson
      1 is kind of cool
      1 is it would make
      1 i sit down and

      1 is increasingly being adopted
      1 is how flexible the
      1 is good enough if
      1 is gonna put you
      1 is going and what
      1 is fairly similar to
      1 is entirely devoted to
      1 is clearly different from

      1 is another area that
      1 is an it minor
      1 is an ideal place
      1 is a new phenomenon
      1 is a major reason
      1 is a major area
      1 is also interested in
      1 is a job that
      1 is a humanities student
      1 is a good skill
      1 is a fundamental gap
      1 is a computer engineering
      1 i really thought about
      1 i really missed in
      1 in writing to an

      1 involved in receiving it
      1 investigating students perspectives this
      1 investigate some of that
      1 in using it products
      1 into the study of

      1 into finding whether there
      1 in this study this
      1 in this study students
      1 in this it course
      1 in thinking cognitive development

      1 interviews were performed during
