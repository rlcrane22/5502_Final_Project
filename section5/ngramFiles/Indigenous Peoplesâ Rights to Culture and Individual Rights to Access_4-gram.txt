we often think of
often think of rights
as simpleyou have a
simpleyou have a right
have a right or
a right or you
right or you dont
so for example if
for example if i
have a property right
a property right to
property right to my
right to my car
to my car then
my car then we
car then we might
then we might think
we might think of
might think of it
think of it as
of it as a
it as a sort
as a sort of
bubble around my cari
around my cari can
my cari can do
cari can do what
can do what i
do what i want
what i want with
i want with my
want with my cardent
with my cardent it
my cardent it with

hammer paint it bright
paint it bright pink
it bright pink and
bright pink and others
pink and others cannot

others cannot do things
cannot do things to
do things to my
things to my car
but rights are almost
