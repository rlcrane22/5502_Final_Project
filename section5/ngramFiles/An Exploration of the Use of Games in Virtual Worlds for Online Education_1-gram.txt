advances
in
computing
and
telecommunications
make
it
possible
to
take
advantage
of
immersive
electronic
environments
to
deliver
content
in
this
paper
we
present
a
policy
game
to
be
used
in
a
virtual
world
the
benefits
of
this
tool
are
examined
using
gees
learning
principles
from
this
analysis
we
find
that
games
in
virtual
worlds
enable
reflective
exploration
that
helps
participants
to
learn
from
their
mistakes
learning
takes
place
from
the
content
conveyed
through
the
game
and
through
the
multimedia
immersion
that
allows
students
to
learn
the
nuances
of
these
virtual
contexts
because
there
are
no
real
world
consequences
participants
can
take
risks
provide
or
receive
help
from
other
students
and
most
importantly
apply
this
knowledge
to
a
real
world
situation
recommendations
are
provided
to
educators
to
help
them
exploit
the
great
potential
of
games
while
being
prepared
for
the
obstacles
that
they
will
face
introduction
the
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
explore
whether
virtual
worlds
can
provide
a
setting
for
a
rewarding
learning
experience
for
college
students
while
online
college
education
is
a
fairly
common
practice
today
most
distance
interactions
with
students
rely
on
relatively
mature
technologies
such
as
course
management
systems
e
g
webct
blackboard
message
boards
electronic
mail
and
weblogs
blogs
these
applications
have
facilitated
the
asynchronous
interaction
of
individuals
located
in
various
places
and
time
zones
however
information
and
communication
technologies
have
advanced
considerably
and
college
professors
now
have
the
opportunity
to
experiment
with
more
innovative
software
applications
that
could
make
online
interactions
more
engaging
and
stimulating
virtual
worlds
represent
one
such
application
in
this
paper
we
explore
the
pedagogical
benefits
of
virtual
worlds
which
we
describe
here
as
graphically
immersive
persistent
shared
and
typically
avatarbased
digital
environments
we
believe
at
the
outset
that
virtual
worlds
offer
instructors
a
potentially
powerful
tool
for
student
learning
and
interaction
through
simulated
experience
the
paper
is
divided
in
five
main
sections
the
first
section
presents
evidence
from
academic
research
of
the
potential
benefits
that
virtual
worlds
can
offer
to
distance
students
here
we
focus
on
video
games
and
virtual
worlds
and
the
educational
benefits
that
they
can
provide
the
section
also
identifies
the
differences
between
virtual
worlds
and
video
games
the
second
section
describes
a
lobbying
game
that
was
adapted
from
a
traditional
classroom
to
a
virtual
world
environment
this
was
done
because
of
the
increasing
popularity
of
online
classes
at
university
campuses
there
is
thus
a
need
to
find
online
activities
that
maintain
the
interest
of
students
here
we
describe
the
simulation
and
the
process
that
we
followed
to
select
a
virtual
world
that
could
work
with
this
simulation
the
third
section
of
the
paper
analyzes
the
educational
value
of
the
lobbying
game
within
the
virtual
world
to
do
this
we
used
gees
learning
principles
and
determined
if
virtual
worlds
offer
those
benefits
the
fourth
section
presents
some
of
the
challenges
to
educators
of
the
process
of
developing
games
for
virtual
worlds
the
fifth
and
last
major
section
prior
to
the
conclusions
talks
about
future
trends
of
virtual
worlds
in
educational
settings
video
and
computer
games
as
pedagogical
tools
work
leisure
and
education
have
all
been
affected
by
advances
in
information
and
communication
technologies
technologies
for
entertainment
purposes
can
be
so
captivating
now
that
traditional
classroom
and
electronic
education
programs
sometimes
pale
in
comparison
the
video
and
computer
game
industry
in
particular
has
evolved
radically
over
the
past
decade
to
offer
interactive
capabilities
that
were
only
imagined
twenty
years
ago
the
cuttingedge
animation
opportunities
for
interaction
and
dynamically
generated
narratives
that
can
be
found
in
todays
games
have
attracted
large
diverse
audiences
and
many
american
teenagers
and
young
adults
play
these
computer
games
on
a
routine
basis

have
the
potential
to

to

these
and
other
results
should
not
be
surprising
given
that
video
and
computer
games
are
widely
perceived
as
vehicles
for
fun
and
play
and
in
such
context
an
association
with
learning
has
the
potential
to
increase

and

i
e
graphic
representations
of

in

virtual
worlds
are
similar
to
video
and
computer
games
in
many
ways
with
a
key
difference
being
that
the
latter
impose
grand
narratives
and
superseding
goals
while
the
former
enable
users
to
pursue
their
own
goals
and
construct
their
own
narratives
the
constructivist
paradigm
that
underlies
virtual
worlds
makes
them
potentially
more
enriching
for
education
experiences
than
traditional
video
games
in
the
process
of
developing
this
chapter
we
needed
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
focus
of
this
book
is
on
educational
games
situated
in
virtual
worlds
in
this
context
we
need
to
think
about
formal
education
as
a
life
long
process
with
the
emergence
of
online
education
more
and
more
adults
are
returning
to
school
to
obtain
higher
degrees
to
change
careers
or
simply
to
upgrade
their
skills
these
are
nontraditional
students
that
already
have
work
experience
and
their
jobs
impede
them
from
participating
in
traditional
classrooms
they
are
instead
embracing
the
flexibility
of
online
education
at
the
same
time
many
of
the
professionals
who
have
recently
entered
the
work
force
are
well
versed
with
technologies
and
as
a
result
educators
have
the
opportunity
to
push
the
envelop
and
provide
online
experiences
that
challenge
them
and
provide
them
with
unique
learning
opportunities
virtual
worlds
play
is
an
activity
that
enhances
childrens
abilities
by
promoting
exploration
and
experimentation
children
create
imagined
worlds
in
their
play
as
we
grow
older
though
our
opportunities
to
explore
and
create
imagined
worlds
are
increasingly
limited
and
our
creativity
is
curbed

there
are
several
elements
that
make
a
game
first
it
should
have
a
set
of
rules
if
the
game
entails
competition
then
there
should
be
a
way
of
determining
who
wins
this
can
be
done
by
specifying
criteria
or
by
identifying
objectives
to
be
met
at
the
end
because
the
purpose
of
an
educational
game
is
to
teach
a
concept
or
a
skill
the
games
should
allow
the
participants
to
learn
or
practice
whatever
skills
or
knowledge
is
meant
to
be
acquired
virtual
worlds
are
often
perceived
to
have
a
steep
learning
curve
and
this
is
a
reason
why
relatively
few
educators
have
made
use
of
virtual

there
are
some
notable
exceptions

bill
would
a
allow
consumers
to
break
copy
controls
to
make
personal
copies
of
audio
tracks
or
movies
from
discs
cds
dvds
they
own
and
b
require
all
copyprotected

and
dvds
to
be
labeled
as

brm
bill
if
passed
the
brm
bill
would
prohibit
a
government
or
any
entity
it
creates
from
offering
broadband
service
for
free
ideally
the
students
will
begin
the
simulation
knowing
a
great
deal
more
about
these
bills
than
what
is
provided
by
these
summaries
two
factors
work
against
this
ideal
though
first
instructions
for
playing
are
relatively
long
even
with
the
summaries
and
would
be
made
even
longer
with
say
an
appendix
detailing
the
bills
specifications
players
of
any
game
tend
to
find
a
thick
stack
of
instructions
daunting
detail
must
always
be
balanced
with
playability
and
a
reasonably
shallow
learning
curve
second
the
chief
pedagogical
aim
of
the
simulation
is
to
teach
lobbying
concepts
if
in
the
process
students
learn
more
about
the
bills
used
to
demonstrate
these
concepts
and
they
most
certainly
will
then
the
simulation
can
be
considered
a
success
on
multiple
levels
however
depending
on
the
course
being
taught
instructors
may
not
have
the
time
to
teach
students
lobbying
concepts
and
the
history
and
particularities
of
the
bills
one
of
the
most
challenging
aspects
of
designing
this
simulation
is
the
need
to
establish
a
level
playing
field
at
the
outset
in
other
words
at
the
start
of
each
simulation
each
bill
should
have
to
the
extent
possible
an
equal
number
of
roles
with
explicit
voting
preferences
supporting
and
opposing
it
to
run
a
simulation
in
which
say
eight
players
initially
oppose
a
bill
serves
to
disadvantage
and
possibly
discourage
the
four
players
who
favor
it
we
created
roles
that
to
varying
degrees
and
in
various
ways
had
a
stake
in
one
two
or
all
three
of
the
bills
listed
above
we
chose
to
create
roles
because
believed
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
coordinate
the
conversations
and
lobbying
efforts
of
a
larger
group
during
the
simulation
these
roles
included
the
governor
of
the
state
of
new
york
the
vice
president
of
aoltime
warner
the
director
of
the
computer
communications

ala
the
deputy
secretary
of
the
u
s
department
of
higher
education
and
a
united
states
senator
from
the
state
of
new
york
a
final
and
important
design
choice
for
this
simulation
is
the
decision
to
include
or
exclude
explicit
voting
preferences
for
each
role
at
the
outset
in
other
words
instructors
can
opt
to
tell
students
how
they
in
their
roles
intend
at
least
initially
to
vote
on
each
bill
or
they
can
withhold
this
information
and
let
the
students
decide
this
for
themselves
based
on
a
brief
statement
of
their
roles
mission
which
is
provided
to
them
by
the
instructor
as
with
the
level
of
detail
on
selected
bills
this
decision
may
be
influenced
by
time
constraints
pedagogical
objectives
and
assumptions
about
students
abilities
and
diligence
one
of
our
chief
concerns
in
this
game
is
that
students
may
not
take
the
time
to
conduct
rudimentary
research
on
their
roles
and
as
a
result
could
ask
us
for
additional
information
further
we
speculated
that
knowing
how
ones
role
initially
stands
on
a
bill
might
help
students
assume
their
roles
more
faithfully
and
as
a
result
make
them
less
inclined
to
play
and
vote
according
to
personal
preferences
towards
the
bill
finally
if
one
opts
to
tell
students
how
their
role
initially
stands
on
each
bill
then
it
is
essential
to
design
the
simulation
such
that
each
role
has
at
the
outset
an
explicitly
undecided
voting
preference
or
is
said
to
be
merely
leaning
in
one
direction
on
at
least
one
of
the
bills
it
is
hoped
that
this
gives
each
player
greater
freedom
to
try
to
influence
their
fellow
participants
in
this
simulation
two
of
the
roles
the
governor
of
new
york
and
the
u
s
senator
from
new
york
are
designed
as
undecided
on
all
three
bills
perhaps
causing
these
two
roles
to
wield
a
disproportionately
greater
influence
on
voting
outcomes
selecting
a
virtual
world
when
working
on
the
game
we
were
inspired
to
design
and
conduct
an
avatarbased
virtual
simulation
to
offer
students
a
stimulating
alternative
to
the
more
conventional
activities
that
are
enacted
in
physical
classrooms
we
also
wanted
to
break
away
from
the
traditional
bulletin
board
discussions
of
online
education
while
these
conventional
modes
have
been
shown
to
be
pedagogically
useful
we
speculated
that
a
simulation
performed
by
avatars
in
a
graphically
rich
online
environment
might
possess
a
distinctive
quality
that
is
particularly
appealing
to
undergraduate
and
graduate
students
one
of
the
authors
had
already
designed
and
conducted
a
simulation
for
use
in
a
physical
classroom
so
our
tasks
involved
identifying
a
suitable
virtual
world
and
adapting
the
simulation
for
it
we
examined
two
virtual
worlds
second
life
and
habbo
hotel
for
our
purposes
the
power
to
create
and
modify
an
avatar
and
threedimensional
virtual
environment
using
cuttingedge
and
relatively
sophisticated
design
tools
though
impressive
entails
a
steep
learning
curve
for
beginners
this
concern
coupled
with
the
required
us
per
person
membership
cost
which
has
since
been
waived
led
us
to
consider
sulake
corporations
habbo
hotel
a
virtual
world
designed
for
and
marketed
to
teens
sulakes
aim
of
profitably
supporting
affirmative
online
communities
for
paying
teens
though
beneficent
was
not
a
factor
in
our
decision
to
use
habbo
hotel
instead
we
wanted
a
virtual
world
that
lets
typical
nonexpert
users
easily
create
and
use
an
expressive
and
visually
appealing
avatar
makes
it
easy
for
users
to
communicate
through
and
move
their
avatars
provides
private
virtual
space
such
as
a
virtual
room
in
which
members
of
a
small
group
can
interact
comfortably
and
without
interruption
possesses
a
vibrant
interface
or
look
and
feel
that
might
appeal
to
undergraduate
and
graduate
students
and
imposes
no
monetary
costs
on
the
students
participating
in
the
simulation
sulakes
revenues
come
chiefly
from
users
who
purchase
habbo
credits
to
decorate
the
empty
virtual
rooms
as
figure
illustrates
we
furnished
the
lobbying
room
with
assorted
rugs
and
chairs
a
blue
pinstriped
floor
a
potted
palm
tree
and
two
whimsical
plaques
for
the
walls
all
for
us
figure
a
screen
capture
of
the
logrolling
room
in
habbo
hotel
an
authors
avatar
sits
pensively
in
one
of
the
chairs
habbo
hotel
satisfied
our
other
conditions
as
well
all
avatars
look
like
cartoonish
depictions
of
adults
but
some
distinctiveness
can
be
achieved
through
ones
selection
of
skin
color
hair
color
and
style
facial
expression
and
the
style
and
color
of
ones
shirt
pantsskirtshorts
and
shoes
finally
the
authors
each
with
limited
experience
in
virtual
worlds
found
moving
their
avatars
and
navigating
habbo
hotel
relatively
simple
and
straightforward
thus
despite
being
somewhat
concerned
about
the
reactions
of
college
students
to
a
virtual
environment
with
a
somewhat
adolescent
motif
the
authors
chose
to
use
a
specially
designated
room
in
habbo
hotel
as
the
space
in
which
to
conduct
the
simulation
educational
benefits
of
games
in
virtual
worlds
while
it
is
clear
that
students
have
a
lot
more
sources
for
entertainment
and
information
this
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
games
in
virtual
worlds
would
be
beneficial
for
learning
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
games
in
these
online
environments

gee
proposed
in
his
book
entitled
what
video
games
have
to
teach
us
about
learning
and
literacy
many
of
the
learning
principles
that
gee
presents
are
however
closely
related
and
to
simplify
the
presentation
of
the
analysis
with
respect
to
games
and
virtual
worlds
the
authors
grouped
these
principles
into
larger
categories
when
gee
wrote
his
book
he
was
focusing
primarily
on
video
games
and
not
necessarily
on
virtual
worlds
the
goal
of
this
analysis
is
to
determine
if
the
learning
principles
that
he
proposed
in
the
context
of
video
games
can
also
apply
to
virtual
worlds
it
is
also
important
to
realize
that
due
to
the
fact
that
virtual
worlds
are
not
games
per
se
much
of
the
learning
that
takes
place
comes
from
the
games
or
simulations
that
the
instructor
prepares
in
advance
for
the
students
in
this
paper
we
described
an
information
policy
simulation
thus
the
analysis
of
gees
principles
for
this
section
is
done
here
within
the
context
of
that
simulation
active
and
reflective
learning
the
simulation
was
intended
to
teach
students
about
the
strategies
that
lobbyists
of
government
officials
commonly
use
to
influence
policy
in
this
case
each
student
played
the
role
of
a
different
character
and
was
asked
to
influence
to
vote
in
favor
of
their
characters
interests
the
simulation
used
the
habbo
hotel
platform
the
simulation
required
the
students
to
identify
the
viewpoints
of
other
characters
and
then
try
to
influence
them
through
conversation
the
students
have
the
opportunity
to
experiment
with
multiple
strategies
as
they
participate
in
the
game
they
have
to
discover
the
positions
of
those
who
do
not
share
their
views
and
then
think
critically
about
the
arguments
that
they
can
use
to
convert
them
to
their
side
they
can
also
experiment
and
strategize
to
make
their
influencing
efforts
more
effective
this
process
of
discovery
and
being
actively
engaged
in
the
activity
help
them
learn
the
complexities
of
the
lobbying
process
first
hand
context
oriented
learning
one
of
the
major
advantages
of
virtual
worlds
and
games
is
the
many
opportunities
that
students
have
to
learn
from
new
environments
and
be
able
to
adapt
to
new
circumstances
a
virtual
world
offers
multiple
opportunities
for
that
first
every
time
that
a
person
enters
a
virtual
world
they
need
to
learn
from
the
context
itself
the
design
other
characters
and
virtual
artifacts
they
also
have
the
opportunity
of
learning
from
a
variety
of
media
such
as
graphics
text
sounds
and
even
voice
from
the
context
and
the
different
media
they
need
to
find
the
meaning
of
these
elements
and
the
culture
of
this
virtual
world
to
determine
norms
of
conduct
it
is
through
careful
observation
that
students
learn
these
subtleties
in
the
context
of
the
policy
simulation
the
students
need
to
determine
whether
it
is
better
to
shout
to
speak
or
to
whisper
a
given
comment
some
of
these
text
speaking
modes
will
be
acceptable
under
certain
circumstances
while
others
will
not
they
need
to
determine
if
it
is
better
to
lobby
a
group
of
people
at
once
or
somebody
alone
they
need
to
determine
how
to
initiate
a
conversation
or
how
to
join
a
conversation
that
has
already
started
all
of
these
norms
of
conduct
are
each
new
opportunities
for
experimentation
and
learning
they
can
become
more
attuned
to
small
subtleties
in
changes
that
happen
in
the
environment
that
surrounds
them
or
in
the
people
that
participate
this
type
of
experience
is
difficult
to
emulate
in
the
real
world
because
it
is
not
easy
to
move
individuals
to
totally
different
contexts
this
is
even
more
challenging
for
online
classes
where
it
will
be
impossible
to
bring
everyone
to
a
single
location
the
more
that
students
participate
in
this
type
of
activity
the
more
likely
that
their
senses
will
be
sharpened
and
they
will
be
able
to
more
easily
adapt
to
many
different
types
of
circumstances
in
the
context
of
the
policy
simulation
the
students
are
putting
themselves
in
a
virtual
world
where
they
are
experiencing
real
time
interaction
with
their
peers
who
are
each
playing
roles
their
behavior
in
a
synchronous
environment
will
thus
differ
from
the
behavior
that
they
are
accustomed
to
from
bulletin
boards
in
this
setting
they
have
to
spend
some
time
learning
about
the
interests
of
the
people
that
they
need
to
lobby
they
need
to
be
able
to
identify
them
as
each
of
the
participants
is
represented
in
the
virtual
world
as
an
avatar
thus
they
need
to
observe
all
of
the
characters
carefully
to
be
able
to
identify
the
person
that
they
want
to
influence
much
of
the
learning
is
not
dictated
but
rather
comes
from
participating
in
the
game
transfer
of
knowledge
while
the
students
learn
from
the
context
and
the
characters
that
participate
in
the
game
the
most
important
element
of
the
game
is
the
possibility
of
being
able
to
transfer
the
knowledge
that
they
learn
from
the
virtual
environment
to
real
life
situation
in
the
case
of
the
policy
simulation
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
game
is
not
necessarily
to
learn
the
skills
of
a
lobbyist
it
is
true
that
part
of
the
content
that
they
need
to
learn
for
the
information
policy
class
is
the
different
theories
about
influence
but
this
type
of
information
is
not
relevant
to
them
unless
they
can
find
a
way
of
applying
it
some
fields
have
direct
connections
with
policy
while
others
are
indirect
it
will
be
easier
for
students
in
fields
with
stronger
policy
connections
to
apply
what
they
learn
learning
through
practice
it
is
clear
that
many
kids
are
highly
skilled
at
playing
video
games
this
happens
because
they
have
the
opportunity
to
practice
countless
times
which
eventually
improves
their
skills
at
whatever
task
they
need
to
complete
virtual
worlds
have
the
potential
of
providing
this
type
of
practice
but
it
is
much
more
limited
within
the
context
of
a
class
because
it
will
require
the
presence
of
other
students
the
possibility
for
practice
will
depend
on
how
open
the
teacher
wants
to
make
the
environment
in
order
to
provide
students
with
opportunities
for
practice
there
will
need
to
be
a
critical
mass
of
participants
all
of
whom
know
the
instructions
while
this
could
be
possible
within
the
context
of
a
commercial
virtual
world
it
is
less
likely
to
be
the
case
for
an
educational
game
one
of
the
things
that
educators
should
keep
in
mind
when
developing
or
modifying
games
for
these
virtual
worlds
is
the
graduated
experience
that
the
participant
gets
when
playing
the
games
these
games
begin
with
simple
tasks
and
then
over
time
the
tasks
become
more
complex
it
is
for
this
reason
that
young
people
return
again
and
again
to
play
because
they
know
that
they
can
with
practice
reach
a
higher
level
with
a
higher
level
there
is
also
the
reward
of
finding
new
things
new
experiences
and
new
challenges
this
should
be
taken
into
account
when
setting
up
a
game
for
a
virtual
world
easier
tasks
should
come
first
and
then
adding
modules
or
changing
the
rules
to
add
more
elements
of
greater
complexity
can
potentially
keep
the
students
interested
in
the
game
to
be
enthusiastic
about
playing
the
lobbying
simulation
that
was
presented
in
this
paper
was
not
designed
in
this
manner
it
was
set
to
be
played
once
with
a
specific
set
of
rules
the
game
could
be
modified
to
have
for
example
a
session
where
the
lobbyists
organize
and
then
a
session
with
potential
policy
makers
this
can
at
least
provide
more
than
one
opportunity
to
interact
with
the
content
of
the
class
as
well
as
providing
two
different
experiences
of
the
learning
principles
identified
by
gee
the
ones
related
to
practice
are
perhaps
the
most
difficult
to
achieve
within
the
context
of
a
game
in
a
virtual
world
learning
through
achievement
people
are
limited
in
their
tolerance
of
disappointment
it
has
been
shown
that
most
people
react
more
positively
to
positive
than
to
negative
feedback

as
a
failure
but
as
an
attempt
young
people
are
thus
not
discouraged
and
instead
try
a
new
strategy
taking
risks
given
that
failure
in
games
does
not
translate
into
failure
in
real
life
the
benefit
of
taking
risks
outweighs
the
costs
of
losing
it
is
precisely
because
of
this
that
players
have
the
opportunity
of
learning
from
the
many
attempts
that
they
make
in
these
worlds
the
policy
simulation
in
habbo
hotel
allows
the
students
to
try
multiple
strategies
to
try
to
influence
their
peers
they
can
use
scare
tactics
provide
statistical
information
that
supports
their
point
make
deals
to
trade
votes
or
work
with
others
who
have
similar
interests
to
try
to
influence
the
policy
issues
at
stake
if
for
example
they
failed
to
influence
one
person
they
may
try
a
different
technique
the
next
time
and
with
trial
and
error
be
able
to
determine
the
strategies
that
work
best
success
in
a
simple
controlled
and
fun
environment
keeps
students
interested
in
a
task
having
achieved
success
in
easier
tasks
motivates
them
to
try
more
complicated
ones
educators
when
developing
games
or
simulations
should
think
about
the
opportunities
that
they
offer
students
to
achieve
success
to
motivate
them
to
take
on
more
difficult
content
or
skills
self
learning
virtual
worlds
provide
opportunities
for
people
to
learn
about
themselves
and
about
others
educators
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
virtual
worlds
are
not
bound
by
the
laws
of
nature
and
they
are
not
as
bound
by
traditional
social
rules
with
this
in
mind
games
for
these
worlds
can
be
developed
with
great
creativity
and
in
a
fantastic
world
depending
on
the
subject
matter
educators
can
ask
students
to
take
on
real
or
fictional
characters
for
whom
they
will
then
take
on
different
behavioral
traits
in
this
process
of
assuming
somebody
elses
persona
they
can
learn
much
about
the
circumstances
that
the
person
faces
and
the
problems
or
benefits
of
having
such
a
life
this
can
then
give
them
an
opportunity
to
compare
the
situation
of
this
fictional
character
with
their
own
life
and
learn
from
having
or
facing
different
circumstances
in
the
lobbying
game
the
students
are
given
the
opportunity
to
be
politicians
librarians
ceos
presidents
and
in
these
roles
they
will
then
have
to
learn
about
each
of
these
characters
interests
as
well
as
the
interests
of
others
to
be
able
to
be
effective
at
lobbying
for
their
cause
evidence
of
the
type
of
understanding
that
can
take
place
between
people
when
they
take
different
characters
is
exemplified
by
eric
brown
and
asi
buraks
game
peacemaker
which
won
the
public
diplomacy
and
virtual
worlds
competition
organized
by
the
university
of
southern
californias
center
on
public
diplomacy
in
the
game
the
participants
take
either
israeli
or
palestinian
characters
and
the
objective
is
to
make
peace
this
sort
of
simulation
could
involve
roles
such
as
a
ceo
a
youth
counselor
or
a
terrorist
by
taking
somebody
elses
identity
students
can
learn
about
content
and
context
that
in
the
past
were
only
available
in
books
they
can
form
opinions
about
a
situation
not
from
the
detached
and
foreign
context
of
books
but
from
actually
living
the
experience
itself
within
a
virtual
world
these
experiences
also
help
them
form
their
own
views
and
learn
about
their
own
values
and
interests
content
the
quality
of
content
is
critical
for
educators
while
lectures
and
discussion
boards
in
an
online
environment
allow
students
to
talk
about
an
issue
and
reflect
on
the
issue
at
hand
this
knowledge
can
be
superficial
and
likely
to
be
forgotten
in
a
virtual
world
students
are
put
in
the
middle
of
situations
in
a
unique
context
as
a
result
they
are
more
likely
to
remember
the
issues
illustrated
given
that
they
will
inevitably
have
to
make
more
effort
in
preparing
and
in
testing
many
alternative
actions
the
mistakes
they
make
and
the
successes
they
have
will
be
remembered
longer
their
reading
now
has
a
more
concrete
even
if
fictional
context
they
can
now
decide
the
type
of
information
that
is
more
relevant
for
the
situation
they
are
given
the
opportunity
to
select
information
on
an
as
needed
basis
and
take
and
relate
information
that
is
important
for
the
type
of
activity
that
they
are
engaged
in
this
process
thus
allows
for
a
much
deeper
level
of
knowledge
the
scope
of
topics
that
can
be
explored
is
nearly
unlimited
in
second
life
for
example
people
can
develop
businesses
pay
for
items
with
virtual
world
currency
and
develop
real
state
universities
and
other
organizations
can
have
a
virtual
presence
virtual
worlds
are
not
limited
by
the
physics
and
rules
of
the
real
world
and
thus
can
create
more
memorable
situations
in
addition
real
world
situations
can
be
emulated
in
a
virtual
world
this
flexibility
of
the
medium
can
allow
educators
to
convey
a
wide
variety
of
information
these
activities
are
however
time
consuming
to
create
a
major
disincentive
for
educators
it
is
much
easier
to
lecture
for
two
hours
on
a
subject
than
to
develop
a
game
write
clear
instructions
see
that
students
go
to
a
virtual
world
and
develop
their
characters
and
then
hope
that
the
technology
will
work
as
expected
it
is
much
more
labor
intensive
for
the
same
amount
of
knowledge
conveyed
in
the
lobbying
simulation
much
preparation
had
to
be
done
ahead
of
time
and
the
students
were
required
to
participate
in
an
orientation
session
before
they
were
actually
able
to
participate
in
the
game
in
order
to
minimize
the
amount
of
time
necessary
to
play
an
educational
game
the
instructor
should
try
to
think
of
several
concepts
that
can
be
bundled
together
such
that
one
effort
is
able
to
convey
more
knowledge
alternatively
one
game
can
be
built
in
a
modular
manner
such
as
content
experienced
at
various
times
in
an
incremental
way
bundling
and
gradualism
are
thus
two
important
components
for
an
effective
delivery
of
content
in
a
virtual
world
activity
social
learning
prior
to
data
networks
video
games
were
solitary
and
players
interacted
with
the
computer
alone
with
the
advent
of
the
internet
and
the
expansion
of
broadband
games
have
increasingly
involved
interaction
among
human
players
virtual
worlds
in
their
massively
multiplayer
form
could
not
have
existed
without
the
internet
because
the
nature
of
the
experience
relies
on
the
existence
of
other
participants
educators
can
take
advantage
of
the
social
aspect
of
the
game
to
foster
collaboration
a
game
although
generally
conceived
as
a
zero
sum
experience
can
be
developed
so
that
effective
collaboration
rather
than
direct
competition
leads
to
winning
in
the
lobbying
game
social
interaction
is
central
to
the
success
of
the
simulation
communication
allows
the
participants
to
practice
their
skills
at
influence
in
this
case
winners
of
the
game
were
those
that
were
able
to
convert
more
individuals
to
get
a
bill
to
be
voted
in
their
favor
this
type
of
game
can
create
intellectual
conflicts
because
a
participant
can
be
required
to
argue
for
and
vote
for
a
policy
that
heshe
disapproves
of
challenges
for
educators
using
games
in
virtual
worlds
while
there
are
many
potential
rewards
as
described
in
the
previous
section
there
are
also
important
challenges
that
educators
need
to
keep
in
mind
when
developing
games
for
virtual
worlds
we
were
able
to
identify
these
challenges
from
the
process
of
developing
the
lobbying
game
the
first
and
greatest
challenge
is
to
develop
the
game
itself
most
university
faculty
do
not
have
formal
training
in
education
much
less
game
development
however
educators
should
realize
that
in
the
internet
era
it
should
not
be
difficult
for
them
to
find
games
designed
for
classroom
use
that
could
be
adapted
for
a
virtual
world
this
can
substantially
reduce
the
development
time
second
while
there
are
games
already
developed
these
have
not
been
archived
in
a
single
location
and
thus
it
will
take
some
time
and
effort
to
find
them
third
the
adaptation
process
is
still
time
consuming
because
detailed
instructions
need
to
be
written
for
the
students
as
a
group
as
well
as
specific
instructions
for
the
participating
characters
to
make
sure
that
the
game
works
the
professor
should
test
the
game
a
couple
of
times
with
a
small
group
of
students
to
find
weaknesses
before
using
it
in
a
class
fourth
technology
is
unpredictable
even
in
the
process
of
developing
the
game
without
yet
having
it
tested
with
students
we
experienced
technological
difficulties
in
our
case
the
authors
could
not
enter
the
virtual
world
by
mistake
because
one
of
us
was
entering
the
american
site
while
the
other
had
prepared
the
lobbying
room
from
the
english
site
while
this
is
a
minor
mistake
other
technical
problems
can
easily
happen
in
particular
regarding
speed
of
connectivity
and
learning
to
navigate
and
function
in
a
virtual
world
to
minimize
the
technical
problems
it
will
be
desirable
as
suggested
before
that
the
professor
familiarize
the
students
with
the
virtual
world
before
running
the
simulation
fifth
anonymity
poses
difficulties
in
entertainmentbased
virtual
worlds
anonymity
can
lead
to
negative
behaviors
that
if
present
in
an
educational
setting
can
severely
affect
the
dynamics
of
the
game
in
an
anonymous
environment
the
participant
may
take
more
risks
but
these
can
be
undesirable
risks
from
the
perspective
of
others
educators
thus
have
to
consider
the
behavioral
standards
that
would
be
acceptable
in
the
virtual
world
while
the
game
is
taking
place
the
teacher
should
consider
when
to
reprimand
and
even
expel
a
student
who
engages
in
inappropriate
behavior
in
all
of
these
situations
testing
the
game
before
using
it
in
a
class
will
help
to
minimize
these
challenges
future
trends
virtual
worlds
are
still
new
environments
that
are
likely
to
evolve
into
complex
settings
that
can
provide
rich
and
challenging
experiences
for
students
online
distance
education
is
based
on
the
traditional
campus
education
however
because
it
is
no
longer
necessary
to
be
physically
present
in
a
campus
there
is
thus
no
need
to
have
the
student
admitted
to
a
particular
university
to
be
able
to
take
a
class
it
is
thus
possible
that
in
the
future
we
could
see
models
where
students
can
develop
their
classes
a
la
carte
and
be
able
to
select
from
a
variety
of
topics
from
different
institutions
and
obtain
a
customized
degree
virtual
worlds
could
become
the
online
classroom
of
the
future
in
place
of
traditional
bulletin
boards
in
these
settings
the
professor
can
immerse
the
student
in
the
context
that
relates
to
the
content
of
the
class
these
experiential
learning
encounters
can
also
be
recorded
and
serve
as
reference
and
future
learning
for
students
that
were
unable
to
attend
in
virtual
worlds
distance
does
not
matter
and
thus
students
can
moved
from
one
situation
to
another
in
a
matter
of
seconds
different
topics
covered
in
the
curriculum
could
thus
take
place
in
multiple
contexts
students
which
were
situated
in
a
classroom
alone
or
on
a
bulletin
board
alone
could
now
be
taken
to
multiple
settings
for
many
of
the
topics
of
the
class
with
the
popularity
of
educational
games
in
virtual
worlds
open
source
efforts
by
faculty
and
students
will
help
to
develop
more
simulations
these
worlds
will
allow
developers
to
work
together
on
the
development
of
a
simulated
environment
and
learn
in
the
process
as
well
in
addition
because
of
these
experiences
the
learning
curve
that
we
experience
today
will
be
reduced
because
these
setting
will
become
second
nature
to
students
and
extensive
tutorials
prior
to
games
will
not
be
necessary
in
virtual
worlds
students
do
not
need
to
take
only
human
personae
but
also
any
other
organisms
thus
a
student
learning
about
zoology
can
become
an
insect
for
example
and
experience
first
hand
the
life
of
this
organism
a
chemistry
student
can
become
a
molecule
and
once
again
see
first
hand
how
they
interact
with
other
elements
in
the
context
of
life
long
learning
students
who
are
about
to
enter
college
can
get
to
know
what
the
life
of
a
stock
broker
or
an
archeologist
or
a
scientist
is
like
these
simulations
can
move
high
school
students
from
shadow
career
days
that
are
difficult
to
coordinate
and
expensive
to
implement
to
virtual
worlds
where
they
can
actually
experience
the
careers
that
they
are
considering
at
the
edges
one
of
the
most
exciting
parts
of
virtual
worlds
can
occur
when
the
simulation
is
no
longer
a
game
and
becomes
a
reality
real
world
interactions
and
economic
transactions
take
place
a
class
that
started
with
a
simulation
and
a
role
playing
game
can
enter
the
real
world
through
a
virtual
experience
imagine
for
example
a
psychology
student
who
is
learning
to
become
a
therapist
in
a
role
playing
game
he
could
initially
have
patients
through
role
play
but
after
gaining
some
experience
they
could
provide
counseling
online
to
people
who
are
unable
to
attend
a
therapy
session
in
person
a
student
can
thus
learn
in
a
controlled
environment
prior
to
encountering
patients
conclusion
there
are
several
lessons
that
can
be
learned
from
games
in
virtual
worlds
first
it
is
clear
that
the
medium
provides
students
many
opportunities
to
learn
about
themselves
through
taking
on
multiple
personae
or
even
other
entities
they
can
learn
from
participating
in
many
contexts
each
of
which
can
provide
different
content
a
multimedia
environment
in
a
digitally
literate
society
can
help
to
enrich
the
experience
making
the
learning
much
more
immersive
and
compelling
the
social
interactions
can
also
support
learning
by
allowing
collaborations
these
virtual
worlds
will
become
the
online
education
of
the
future
because
of
the
flexibility
and
the
richness
that
educational
games
can
provide
students
at
this
point
in
time
however
there
are
important
challenges
to
overcome
these
can
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
we
are
just
beginning
to
utilize
this
medium
for
distance
education
and
we
do
not
yet
have
the
tools
and
the
skills
to
develop
games
and
work
with
students
even
though
students
today
are
more
technologically
sophisticated
most
have
not
yet
been
exposed
to
this
type
of
experience
thus
the
learning
curve
for
them
is
still
steep
few
faculty
members
are
sufficiently
aware
of
these
simulated
environments
and
thus
few
resources
have
been
provided
to
facilitate
this
type
of
education
however
the
increasing
popularity
of
these
worlds
and
the
presence
of
some
universities
and
companies
inside
them
will
create
the
critical
mass
necessary
to
make
development
of
the
environment
much
easier
such
as
the
creation
of
libraries
that
collect
virtual
world
games
and
simulations
for
the
many
disciplines
that
are
taught
today
in
our
campuses
the
physical
worlds
will
no
longer
dictate
the
rules
of
the
virtual
worlds
and
over
time
a
completely
different
educational
experience
can
become
the
distance
education
of
the
future
