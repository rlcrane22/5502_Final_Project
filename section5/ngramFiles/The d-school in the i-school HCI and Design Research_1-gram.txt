college
of
information
sciences
and

the
pennsylvania
state
university
in
the
context
of
a
campuswide
strategic
planning
process
we
have
been
asked
to
frame
the
special
role
of
penn
states
center
for
humancomputer
interaction
chci
within
the
college
of
information
sciences
and
technology
ist
our
response
is
that
hci
should
fulfill
an
important
role
as
a
focus
for
design
research
within
our
ischool
as
support
for
this
response
we
explore
the
following
propositions
design
research
and
design
science
are
essential
to
ischools
hci
is
historically
currently
and
inherently
a
design
science
of
the
just
right
sort
to
contribute
to
ischools
other
constituenciessubunits
of
ischools
cs
is
lis
sts
are
not
design
sciences
but
benefit
from
organizational
proximity
of
hci
design
research
in
this
brief
paper
we
sketch
the
argument
entailed
by
these
propopsitions
our
objective
is
to
better
understand
and
articulate
the
role
of
hci
and
design
research
in
ischools
design
research
is
essential
to
ischools
ischools
span
the
information
disciplines
to
comprehensively
address
issues
ranging
from
image
processing
to
social
policy
in
this
vast
spectrum
designdefined
here
as
materializing
information
to
support
human
activityis
a
fulcrum
one
cannot
talk
about
information
processing
storage
and
retrieval
information
behavior
the
use
of
information
in
groups
organizations
or
in
society
or
information
economics
policy
and
regulation
without
making
strong
and
substantive
assumptions
about
the
specific
ways
that
information
can
be
presented
to
and
manipulated
by
people
indeed
whenever
there
is
evolution
in
user
interfaces
and
application
services
other
concepts
and
relations
throughout
information
science
must
be
rethought
there
are
perfectly
coherent
and
timetested
information
disciplines
that
eschew
a
central
concern
with
design
as
we
define
it
the
core
of
computer
science
cs
is
focused
on
information
processing
storage
and
retrieval
presentation
and
manipulation
of
information
by
people
and
the
design
process
itself
are
peripheral
topics
in
cs
library
information
science
lis
has
traditionally
focused
on
information
retrieval
and
information
seeking
at
the
individual
level
while
information
systems
is
has
focused
on
organizational
processes
and
the
impacts
of
information
access
and
use
but
neither
has
focused
on
framing
and
implementing
specific
design
strategies
to
ameliorate
or
enhance
observed
circumstances
through
transforming
humancomputer
interactions
the
broad
vision
of
ischools
requires
coordination
of
understanding
information
structures
needs
and
impacts
with
the
design
of
new
humancomputer
interactions
design
and
the
artifacts
that
result
from
design
activity
represent
an
important
class
of
boundary
objects
for
knowledge
and
technology
transfer
between
disciplines
and
between
academe
and
industrygovernment
designs
integrate
and
reify
theory
and
empirical
knowledge
into
technologies
that
can
be
exchanged
implemented
and
their
effects
assessed
within
different
contexts
and
from
different
perspectives
similarly
designs
and
artifacts
help
demonstrate
the
potential
utility
of
research
products
hci
is
the
right
kind
of
design
science
until
the
emergence
of
hci
during
the
s
the
roles
for
social
cognitive
and
behavioral
science
within
technology
development
were
few
and
marginal
the
discipline
of
human
factors
institutionalized
within
industrial
engineering
or
applied
psychology
emerged
a
generation
before
hci
but
it
was
most
concerned
with
human
performance
and
experience
with
existing
technology
tools
and
systems
and
focused
on
artifacts
with
limited
information
content
e
g
stairs
furniture
physical
tools
this
evaluation
role
was
often
positioned
too
late
in
the
system
development
process
to
have
more
than
minor
effects
on
the
design
of
the
technology
or
on
the
core
applications
of
technology
science
and
technology
studies
sts
institutionalized
variously
in
philosophy
and
sociology
lis
typically
a
standalone
academic
unit
some
of
which
have
developed
into
ischools
communication
studies
and
is
institutionalized
in
business
schools
all
have
provided
descriptions
of
how
technology
is
utilized
across
a
broad
range
of
significant
organizational
and
utilitarian
contexts
particularly
in
the
case
of
sts
these
were
often
rich
analyses
of
how
new
technology
is
shaped
by
use
and
how
it
reciprocally
shapes
human
practices
relationships
and
institutions
such
efforts
contribute
much
to
understanding
the
context
of
information
technology
design
problems
and
solutions
but
they
are
even
more
distant
from
the
activities
of
system
design
and
development
than
human
factors
efforts
and
unfortunately
technologists
were
largely
unaware
that
these
fields
of
interest
even
existed
in
this
context
hci
is
quite
novel
it
has
been
most
often
institutionalized
as
an
adjunct
to
sometimes
even
within
computer
science
its
research
methods
integrate
the
creation
of
new
techniques
technology
and
applications
with
iterative
and
formative
evaluation
of
their
immediate
and
indirect
impacts
on
collective
and
individual
human
activity
and
experience
the
close
coordination
of
creating
innovative
technology
and
assessing
its
consequences
for
human
activity
has
proven
very
successful
and
has
led
to
transformative
applicationsdesktop

were
unimaginable

decades
ago
indeed
a
paradigm
of
innovation
and
application
of
interactive
technologies
cyclically
coupled
to
improvisation
and
assessment
in
human
activity
has
been
incorporated
into
academic
programs
in
geoscience
is
cs
lis
and
ischools
and
is
generally
called
hci
however
this
paradigm
is
not
itself
a
discipline
and
when
it
is
incorporated
into
specific
information
technology
disciplines
and
projects
it
is
typically
narrowed
to
the
scope
of
that
discipline
or
project
for
example
hci
in
cs
most
typically
means
research
on
software
architectures
or
tools
that
enable
new
user
interface
techniques
we
propose
that
only
in
ischools
can
hci
operate
with
the
appropriate
scope
to
be
effective

a

benefit
incorporating
hci
into
ischools
yields
many
benefits
for
other
ischool
constituencies
while
at
the
same
time
broadening
and
enriching
hci
design
research
already
the
combination
of
hci
and
lis
in
ischools
has
led
to
richer
conceptions
of
humancentered
design
that
encompass
both
the
measurement
orientation
of
hci
and
the
integration
of
information
organization
technology
policy
and
culture
of
lis
the
interaction
of
hci
with
community
informatics
has
promoted
design
research
that
addresses
new
sorts
of
public
access
information
systems
and
has
produced
a
more
finely
articulated
view
of
people
as
the
central
factor
in
the
interactions
between
people
information
and
technology
at
different
levels
of
social
aggregation
traditional
cs
research
considers
underlying
technologies
but
rarely
addresses
design
in
the
sense
of
envisioning
new
tools
and
activities
for
people
instead
cs
design
efforts
are
more
likely
to
lead
to
selfconsistent
functionality
with
unknown
implications
for
people
and
their
activity
e
g
a
programming
language
or
perhaps
to
a
proofofconcept
prototype
application
that
demonstrates
a
plausible
use
of
a
novel
technology
or
technique
incorporating
hci
expertise
in
such
work
ensures
that
the
design
of
effective
applications
is
a
firstorder
concern
and
helps
to
coordinate
the
development
of
new
technologies
with
new
measurement
techniques
they
necessitate
is
has
an
inherent
orientation
toward
action
science
and
affecting
change
but
generally
has
accomplished
this
through
organizational
interventions
of
training
management
and
technology
acquisition
the
ability
to
design
and
implement
new
forms
of
humancomputer
interactions
as
part
of
is
interventions
is
a
powerful
enhancement
other
constituencies
like
sts
that
have
traditionally
played
even
more
peripheral
roles
with
respect
to
technology
e
g
focusing
on
impacts
or
critically
deconstructing
meanings
can
participate
in
a
more
directive
fashion
when
supported
by
colleagues
who
do
this
as
a
central
element
of
their
technical
work
our
construal
of
the
role
of
hci
in
ischools
as
an
anchor
for
design
research
has
more
general
implications
for
how
we
think
of
ischool
faculty
groups
for
example
at
penn
state
we
have
often
identified
faculty
groupings
concerned
with
people
and
technology
people
and
information
or
information
and
technology
not
surprisingly
such
distinctions
do
little
to
energize
engagement
across
groupings
perhaps
differentiating
faculty
groups
based
on
how
they
pursue
research
questions
in
the
ispace
which
is
a
nexus
of
information
technology
and
people
and
equally
important
how
their
methods
and
approaches
can
complement
others
would
be
more
productive
