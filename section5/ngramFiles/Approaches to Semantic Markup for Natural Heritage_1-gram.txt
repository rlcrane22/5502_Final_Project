introduction
since
over
two
hundred
years
ago
the
work
has
started
to
systematically
document
various
living
organisms
their
habitats
geographic
distribution
classification
and
identification
keys
current
projects
of
such
include
the
flora
of
north
american
fna
and
the
flora
of
china
foc
as
a
result
a
wealth
of
natural
heritage
literature
has
been
produced
however
the
vast
majority
of
natural
heritage
literature
is
still
in
print
format
that
in
electronic
format
is
mainly
in
html
pdf
or
doc
formats
for
example
volumes
of
fna
and
foc
are
both
in
print
and
html
formats
only
a
small
percentage
of
such
information
is
stored
in
a
structured
digital
format
such
as
relational
database
or
xml
format
to
construct
the
global
commons
of
natural
heritage
literature
as
envisioned
by
the
biodiversity
heritage
library
an
international
collaboration
among
major
natural

a
number
of
digitization
projects
are
being
planned
or
carried
out
at
different
levels
related
standard
organizations
such
as
the
biodiversity

are
working
intensively
on

an
xml
application
to
meet
the
immediate
needs
of
digitization
projects
for
a
review
of
xml
schemas
for
biodiversity
literature
see
natural
heritage
communities
have
come
to
the
consensus
that
the
reformatting
of
unstructured
biodiversity
literature
especially
taxonomic
descriptions
of
living
organisms
into
a
machine
readable
structured
format
is
necessary
for
the
long
term
and
effective
management
of
the
large
body
of
literature
this
reformatting
benefits
both
of
the
two
major
usages
of
the
information
namely
organism
identification
and
information
retrieval
for
the
attendees
of
the
iconference
structured
formats
enable
more
accurate
retrieval
is
probably
a
wellaccepted
fact
that
calls
for
no
more
elaboration
we
should
nonetheless
note
that
the
organism
descriptions
in
a
good
structured
format
that
allows
the
encoding
of
biological
characters
and
their
statesvalues
also
support
faceted
browsing
and
cross
collection
i
e
federated
retrieval
the
specimen
identification
task
is
traditionally
performed
by
using
taxonomic
keys
which
are
decision
trees
upsidedown
trees
with
the
root
node
on
top
with
contrasting
statements
about
a
biological
character
in
each
node
and
an
identification
at
the
end
of
each
branch
it
is
worth
noting
that
research
has
shown
that
full
text
information
retrieval
techniques
are
not
effective
for
specimen
identification
tasks
the
creation
of
a
good
taxonomic
key
for
a
group
of
taxa
relies
on
the
completeness
of
the
descriptions
and
exhaustive
search
and
comparison
of
the
descriptions
of
related
organisms
any
taxonomist
can
testify
that
neither
of
the
two
conditions
is
supported
well
by
freetext
descriptions
it
is
easy
for
an
author
to
leave
out
some
characters
it
is
tedious
to
repeat
shared
characteristics
again
and
again
in
many
descriptions
and
on
top
of
these
it
is
also
very
timeconsuming
to
search
for
missing
characters
and
compare
many
freetext
descriptions
at
one
time
a
structured
format
can
alleviate
these
difficulties
because
it
allows
an
information
system
to
remind
an
author
of
the
missing
elements
and
to
autofill
the
shared
characteristics
it
is
also
possible
for
computers
to
shoulder
some
work
involved
in
comparing
descriptions
thanks
to
the
structures
that
are
made
explicit
to
computers
enabling
more
meaningful
comparisons
element
by
element
rather
than
blind
keyword
matching
if
the
descriptions
are
markedup
in
very
fine
details
for
example
to
the
level
of
characters
and
character
states
it
is
even
possible
to
automate
many
aspects
of
the
generation
of
taxonomic
keys
a
sustainable
way
to
transform
large
sets
of
free
text
descriptions
to
structured
formats
should
not
rely
on
grant
moneys
and
graduate
assistants
manual
labor
automatic
semantic
markup
techniques
must
be
explored
to
convert
newly
digitized
full

documents
into
a
structured

taxonomists
to
convert

freshly

related
research
the
majority
of
work
on

taxonomic
descriptions
focuses
on
the
paragraphs
with
limited
semantics
such
as
taxon
names
and
ranks
etc

less

focused
on
a

syntactic

methods
require
handcraft
grammar
rules
and
extensive
lexicons
to
guide
the

can
be

therefore
the
usefulness
of
a
parser
for
different
collections
can
be
limited
a

also
been
built

it
requires
the
users
to
come

remains
to
be

to
what
extent

by
reusing
domain
knowledge

achieved
better

on

two
machine
learning
techniques
the
machine
learning
approach
has
a
number
of
advantages
over
other
existing
approaches
this
approach
does
not
require
the
markup
or
extraction
rules
to
be
provided
to
the
system
composing
the
rules
by
hand
is
difficult
even
for
trained
knowledge
engineers
or
computer
scientists
because
one
cannot
easily
tell
the
overall
effect
of
a
rule
on
a
large
collectionit
may
work
very
well
with
a
small
portion
of
descriptions
but
results
in
a
net
negative
effect
if
applied
on
the
entire
collection
if
the
goal
is
to
equip
domain
experts
in
this
case
taxonomists
with
the
markup
tool
this
requirement
is
simply
not
reasonable
taking
advantage
of
ever
increasing
computational
power
the
machine
learning
approach
on
the
contrary
strives
to
find
global
optimum
rules
automatically
a
properly
designed
learning
system
also
promotes
portability
of
the
technique
it
is
desirable
for
a
system
to
be
able
to
process
different
collections
of
documents
of
the
same
or
similar
domain
with
little
or
no
reengineering
a
learning
system
that
learns
and
makes
use
of
domain
knowledge
is
more
portable
than
a
system
that
learns
presentation
cues
because
it
is
more
likely
for
the
documents
to
share
domain
knowledge
than
the
presentation
styles
such
as
font
size
color
or
html
tags
since
a
machine
learning
system
learns
markup
rules
from
document
collections
the
markup
rules
are
always
up
to
date
and
reflect
the
characteristics
of
the
current
collection
in
practice
this
works
better
than
relying
on
handcrafted
rules
that
may
not
fit
the
current
task
well
there
are
two
main
types
of
inductive
learning
techniques
supervised
and
unsupervised
learning
techniques
supervised
learning
techniques
require
training
examples
from
which
the
learning
system
derives
knowledge
and
against
which
the
learning
system
verifies
its
learning
training
examples
for
the
martt
system
were
markedup
descriptions
manually
prepared
the
number
of
training
examples
required
by
a
system
varies
depending
on
the
learning
algorithm
and
the
heterogeneity
of
the
data
collection
initially
the
performance
of
a
learning
system
increases
with
the
number
of
training
examples
at
a
certain
point
typically
before
accuracy
it
typically
reaches
a
performance
plateau
when
the
plateau
is
reached
the
system
is
said
to
be
trained
as
more
training
examples
will
not
bring
in
any
performance
gain
unsupervised
learning
techniques
do
away
with
training
examples
they
derive
knowledge
from
the
documents
themselves
by
exploring
the
various
regularities
embedded
in
the
documents
for
either
technique
there
has
to
be
some
source
of
knowledge
that
can
be
exploited
and
the
learning
algorithm
has
to
be
able
to
discover
something
that
is
previously
unknown
to
it
the
supervised
learning
algorithm
aforementioned
martt
system
is
a
supervised
learning
system
involving
two
phases
the
training
phase
and
the
markup

in
the

the

while
in

the

the

at
a
cost

even

the

prompted
us
to
ask
this
research
question
to
what
extent

can
be
exploited
to
produce
xmlbased
markups

are
not

it
possible
for
an
unsupervised

technique
to
achieve
comparable
performance
as
the
supervised
technique
to
what
extent
the
regularities
in
the
text
can
replace
the
knowledge
manifested
in
the
training
examples
the
unsupervised
learning
algorithm
we
started
to
answer
these
questions
by
investigating
a
bootstrapping
approach
this
markup
approach
is
a
bottomup
approach
established
on
the
literary
warrant
principle
it
exploits
the
syntactic
cues
commonly
found
in
domain
corpora
such
cues
include
sentences
typically
start
with
a
subject
the
subjects
are
typically
nouns
or
noun
phrases
periods
are
used
to
end
a
sentence
while
commas
or
semicolons
are
used
to
set
off
clauses

cues
were

the

we
implemented
a
prototype
of
an
application
that
supports
both
of
the
learning
techniques
the
userfriendliness
of
the
application
lies
not
only
on
the
employment
of
sound
interface
design
principles
but
more
importantly
on
the
reasonable
division
of
the
job
between
domain
experts
and
the
computer
the
application
does
not
assume
the
user
has
any
knowledge
engineering
skills
such
as
crafting
regular
expression
patterns
for
markup
but
trusts
the
user
has
the
ability
of
identifying
misplaced
tags
a
few
screenshots
are
included
here
to
illustrate
the
design
of
the
prototype
the
application
assumes
the
user
either
has
folders
of
documents
i
e
batch
processing
or
will
compose
a
description
to
mark
up
the
first
screen
the
user
sees
once
the
application
is
started
allows
the
user
to
either
run
a
learning
algorithm
on
a
folder
of
documents
or
to
skip
the
learning
step
and
go
directly
to
the
main
interface
if
the
user
wishes
to
access
other
functions
figure
note
for
supervised
learning
the
user
needs
to
provide
training

the
main
interface
has
functions
that
help
with
the
preparation
of
training

figure
figure
the
first
screen
allows
if
the
user
chooses
to
use
either
of
the
algorithms
to
mark
up
the
collection
she
will
provide
necessary
information
and
instruct
the
application
to
learn
to
mark
up
since
the
learning
and
markup
process
can
take
a
long
time
depending
on
the
size
of
the
collection
the
interface
informs
the
user
the
progress
figure
if
the
documents
in

the

the
application
will
automatically
assume
the
users
intention
is
to
test
the
performance
of
the
learning
algorithm
it
will
compare
the
given

with
those
generated
by
the
computer
and
compute

scoresfigure
the
performance
scores
are
saved
in

can
compare
the
performances
of
different
runs
note
once
the
learning
is
started
the

is
still

she
would
like

cancel
the
lengthy
learning
progress
and
go
either
to
the

technique
or
to
the
main
interface
to
use
other

when
the
learning

process
is
done
the
user
is
led
to
the
main
interface
where
she
can
verify
the
correctness
of
machinegenerated
markup
using
either
the
supervised
or
unsupervised
approach
by
using
the
batchmode
functions
figure
and
make
any
corrections
by
invoking
the
popup
schema
menu
the
application
maintains
the
list
of
files
to
be
examined
so
the
next
time
the
application
starts
the
user
can
continue
with
the
remaining
of
the
files
the
application
automatically
records
any

the
user
corrects
but
also
allows
the
user
to
add
any
error
manually
by
using
record
an
error
function
in
tools
a
module
will
be
implemented
in
the
future
to
pass
along
the
identified
errors
to
the
learning
algorithms
so
the
algorithms
can
revise
its
markup
rules
in
the
composingmode
the
user
is
presented
a
text
editor
window
where
she
can
compose
a
description
which
will
be
marked
up
in
xml
format
after
the
user
clicks
on
the
mark
up
button
this
oneclick
markup
relies
on
the
knowledge
already
learned
by
martt
the
user
can
check
for

in
the
composing

in
a
similar
manner
as
in
the
batch

figure
learning
progress
figure
the
main
interface
as
mentioned
earlier
the
interface
also
supports
the
preparation
of
training
examples
the
user
simply
opens
a
list
of
examples
highlights
certain
text
segments
and
tags
the
segments
by
selecting
appropriate
elements
from
the
popup
schema
menu
or
the
user
can
use
the
documents
markedup
by
the
unsupervised
algorithm
as
the
training
examples
for
the
supervised
algorithm
in
short
the
application
supports
the
preparation
of
training
examples
two
different
learning
techniques
for
marking
up
documents
two
different
processing
modes
the
verification
and
correction
of
marked
up
documents
and
feedback
to
the
learning
algorithms
all
in
a
rather
userfriendly
manner
an
earlier
prototype
was
used
by
two
noncomputer
science
undergraduates
and
seemed
to
be
straightforward
and
easy
to
use
however
being
a
prototype
there
is
still
room
for
improvements
comparisons
we
ran
a
simple
experiment
to
demonstrate
the
differences
between
the
two
learning
techniques
when
applied
to
semantic
markup
of
taxonomic
descriptions
we
used
descriptions
from
flora
of
north
america
manually
markedup
according
to
the
aforementioned
schema
for
the
supervised
learning
algorithm
the
descriptions
were
evenly
divided
into
two
sets
training
and
test
sets
for
the
unsupervised
learning
algorithm
since
no
training
was
needed
all
descriptions
were
involved
in
the
bootstrapping
neither
algorithms
were
optimized
for
speed
at
this
time
but
it
took
times
as
long
for
the
supervised
learning
algorithm
to
mark
up
descriptions
mins
as
for
the
unsupervised
learning
algorithm
to
mark
up
descriptions
mins
on
a
gateway
ghz
internal
core
cpu
laptop
with
the
java
heap
size
set
to
mb
the
supervised
learning
algorithm
put
of
all
words
in
the
descriptions
in
correct
tags
the
unsupervised
learning
marked
of
the
sentences
correctly
and
identified
good
tags
for
of
the
unique
subjects
it
marked
sentences
unique
subjects
incorrectly
and
couldnt
make
a
decision
on
another
sentences
unique
subjects
comparing
a
description
for
aristolochiaceae
aristolochia
serpentaria
marked
up
using
different
techniques
table
we
see
the
effects
of
the
learning
algorithms
the
unsupervised
learning
produces
wellformed
xml
documents
and
the
tags
are
generated
and
applied
as
the
description
contents
warrant
while
supervised
learning
assumes
a
generic
xml
schema
no
matter
the
description
contents
the
effects
of
this
distinction
are
shown
in
different
ways
the
unsupervised
learning
generally
produced
more
detailed
markup
especially
in
the
leaf
description
than
the
supervised
learning
the
unsupervised
learning
explicitly
marked
organsstructures
hidden
in
other
features
element
produced
by
the
supervised
learning
although
not
shown
in
this
example
the
unsupervised
learning
is
less
constrained
in
dealing
with
uncommon
organization
of
descriptive
contents
for
example
describing
multiple
organsstructures
leaves
and
inflorescence
in
one
sentence
there
were
sentences
with
compound
subjects
in
the
fna
descriptions
on
the
other
hand
the
xml
schema
used
in
supervised
learning
carries
domain
knowledge
although
implicitly
but
allowing
the
translations
of
concepts
at
different
levels
in
this
example
it
marked
up
herbs
as
a
type
of
plant

discussions
what
have
we
learned
from
the
experiment
on
the
randomly
selected
fna
descriptions
first
we
learned
that
the
documents
from
the
real
world
will
contain
information
that
is
not
covered
by
a
predefined
xml
schema
in
the
descriptions
a
tiny
portion
of
fna
new
volumes
of
which
are
still
being
published
organsstructures
were
not
found
in
the
xml
schema
in
addition
there
are
also
descriptive
sentences
with
compound
subjects
which
cannot
be
tagged
as
any
single
organstructure
we
believe
a
semantic
schema
let
it
be
an
xml
schema
or
an
ontology
is
necessary
for
any
semantic
markup
task
to
ensure
consistent
interpretation
the
topdown
approach
to
the
creation
of
such
a
schema
however
does
not
seem
to
be
a
viable
approach
in
order
to
discover
all
organsstructures
described
in
a
collection
we
believe
a
bottomup
approach
based
on
the
literature
warrant
principle
such
as
the
unsupervised
learning
method
described
in
this
paper
is
more
feasible
to
say
the
least
the
unsupervised
learning
method
can
be
used
to
generate
element
candidates
and
to
identify
difficult
cases
unknown
for
the
human
experts
to
base
their
work
on
second
we
saw
that
the
strength
and
weakness
of
the
two
techniques
are
quite
evident
the
unsupervised
technique
is
more
flexible
more
efficient
and
capable
of
uncover
newrare
organsstructures
but
it
has
the
shortcoming
of
unable
to
associate
concepts
with
their
broader
concepts
for
example
it
marks
different
fruit
types
explicitly
yet
unable
to
tell
that
they
share
one
broader
concept
fruit
we
often
assume
that
the
semantic
relationships
among
domain
concepts
have
long
been
codified
in
a
thesaurus
or
something
similar
while
such
assumptions
are
often
unfounded
even
if
they
are
we
still
face
the
issue
of
discrepancies
among
different
thesauri
for
example
if
you
trace
the
hypernymy
relation
of
the
word
nut
in
wordnet
you
will
find
nut
is
a
seed
however
in
the
oxford
plant
characters
thesaurus
nuts
parent
term
is
fruit
in
wordnet
a
capsule
is
a
seed
vessel
but
in
oxford
it
is
a
fruit
fortunately
the
unsupervised
learning
algorithm
reduced
the
workload
for
human
experts
to
make
situated
associations
among
concepts
from
reading
x
sentences
to
examine
y
distinct
tags
in
case
of
the
fna
descriptions
x
y
this
identifies
an
additional
component
to
be
implemented
as
a
part
of
the
martt
interface
application
in
addition
to
support
supervised
and
unsupervised
learning
a
module
is
needed
to
allow
a
human
expert
to
establish
semantic
relationships
among
existing
or
introduced
concepts
this
is
what
we
will
do
