through
this
essay
we
develop
an
argument
for
supporting
the
growth
of
ischools
by
building
on
the
literature
and
concepts
of
institutions
we
first
argue
that
ischools
and
the
ischool
movement
can
be
seen
as
engaging
in
a
process
of
institutionalization
that
is
they
are
seeking
each
and
collectively
to
become
selfsustaining
and
enduring
social
units
to
support
this
argument
we
draw
on
the
literatures
regarding
institutions
and
institutionalization
we
do
so
to
help
clarify
what
those
involved
in
the
ischool
movement
might
need
to
do
to
encourage
the
process
of
ischools
becoming
become
enduring
and
selfreplicating
forms
of
organization
in
the
contemporary
university
milieu
the
literature
on
institutions
and
institutionalizing
is
vast
active
and
multithreaded
in
this
essay
we
draw
from
but
do
not
summarize
or
extend
this
work
we
draw
on
concepts
from
institutional
theory
to
frame
our
thesis
what
can
those
involved
in
ischools
do
to
encourage
the
growth
and
legitimization
of
these
scholarly
institutions
on
becoming
an
institution
an
institution
is
a
representation
of
a
social
order
or
pattern
continually
reproduced
which
owes
its
continued
existence
to
relatively
selfactivating
or
automatic
social
processes

these

to
structure
behavior
and
interaction
and
regulative

an
institution
is
a
set
of
roles
graded
in

that
have
been
embodied
in
consistent
patterns
of

that

when

social
patterns
reproduce
themselves
without
the
need
of

action
or

action

members
painter
in
the
ischool
context
this
is
seen
in
faculty
of
different
research
paradigms
and
from
different
scholarly
disciplines
getting
together
and
resolving
their
difference
to
hire
tenure
and
promote
their
peers
to
recruit
and
educate
graduate
students
and
to
establish
common
language
regarding
interdisciplines
and
interactions
in
doing
this
patterns
of
action
emerge
and
others
seeing
this
replicate
these
patterns
by
choice
routine
procedures
support
and
sustain
the
pattern
furthering
its
reproduction
unless
collective
action
blocks
or
external
shocks
disrupt
the
pattern
jepperson
that
is
formation
is
fragile
and
often
disrupted
by
failures
of
some
to
reproduce
the
act
or
by
outside
forces
that
block
reproduction
seen
this
way
the
ischool
as
institution
arises
out
of
constantly
reenacted
practices
from
which
evolve
stable
sets
of
structures
with
formalized
rules
and
laws
these
structures
of
rules
laws
norms
of
behavior
and
collected
practices
become
visible
to
others
and
are
internalized
by
individuals
in
turn
these
individuals
reinforce
the
normative
and
regulative
aspects
of
an
institution
through
repetition
and
reproduction
institutions
take
many
forms
a
profession
or
occupation
becomes
professionalized
or
institutionalized
when
they
are
believed
to
require
extensive
formalized
study
and
a
mastery
of
specialized
knowledge
are
autonomous
selfrestricted
and
selfregulated
and
generally
exclusive
a
professional
institution
includes
organizational
structures
and
mechanisms
for
preserving
the
knowledge
and
the
practices
of
its
constituents
enforcing
the
standards
and
educating
future
members
of
the
profession

drawing
from
and
combining

we
argue
here
and
in
other
writings
that
a
working
definition
of
a
scholarly
institution
as
one
form
of
professional
institution
focusing
on
academic
missions
and
which
shares
the
following
characteristics
with
all
institutions
automatic
self
replicating
autonomous
selfregulating
structurally
stable
possessing
formalized
norms
and
cultures
visible
having
a
coherent

the
constituent
elements
and
processes
that
go
into
forming
institutions
are
a
very
active
area
of
scholarship

variables
at
the
expense
of
an
examination
of
the
determinants
and
components
of
institutions
and
the
process
by
which
institutions
become
constructed
remains
a
black
box
zucker
in
contrast
our
interest
here
is
to
institutional
formation
one
promising
approach
to
understanding
the
development
of
institutions
is
to
see
it
as
a
structurational
activity
drawing
on
giddens

institutionalization
arises
as
patterns
of
interaction
emerge
out
of
loosely
organized
technical
activities
according
to
the
tenets
of
structuration
theory
institutions
emerge
out
of
a
dynamic
in
which
individuals
are
shaped
by
institutional
forces
and
then
act
upon
their
institutionalized
environments
to
transform
institutional
arrangements

change
comes
about
in
institutional
environments
when
some
event
or
development
breaks
the
patterns
established
by
previously
recurrent
actions
and
reflexive
behavior
of
individuals
seen
this
way
institutionalization
is
the
process
of
these
patterns
of
interaction
becoming
more
stable
in
doing
this
they
serve
to
infuse
a
normative
order
or
a
set
of
normative
values
into
the
organization

what
we
in
ischools
can
do
we
argue
that
becoming
a
scholarly
institution
requires
concerted
local
and
collective
efforts
both
are
required
because
each
ischool
must
pursue
institutional
legitimization
locally
and
collectively
these
ischools
must
also
establish
a
collective
institutional
presence
both
of
these
efforts
must
focus
on
institutional
growth
and
maturity
relative
to
becoming
self
replicating
selfregulating
structurally
stable
and
visible
selfreplicating
and
selfregulating
mean
that
new
ischools
are
started
and
that
there
is
some
coherence
of
identity
across
the
organizational
units
who
claim
to
be
ischools
and
that
all
ischools
collectively
have
a
coherent
set
of
criteria
for
belonging
or
not
by
structurally
stable
we
mean
that
ischools
possess
formalized
norms
and
regulative
activities
such
as
rules
of
local
and
collective
membership
and
some
common
bodies
of
knowledge
by
visible
we
mean
that
ischools
have
a
coherent
outward
appearance
others
can
distinguish
that
a
particular
academic
unit
is
or
is
not
an
ischool
visibility
also
demands
that
ischools
collectively
can
be
discerned
as
a
distinct
academic
form
in
the
rest
of
the
essay
we
raise
issues
and
opportunities
relative
to
each
of
these
five
characteristics
of
a
scholarly
institution
pursuing
self
replication
to
achieve
this
requires
both
a
growth
in
the
number
of
ischool
programs
and
the
development
and
formalization
of
shared
structures
and
norms
several
activities
suggest
this
is
ongoing
for
example
there
are
three
mechanisms
that
bring
together
the
ischool
leaders
and
faculty
the
first
is
the
iconference
which
is
currently
the
only
communitywide
endeavor
that
engages
students
faculty
and
administrative
leadership
the
other
two
the
selfselected
and
independent
ischool
caucus
and
the
computing
research
association
cra
sponsored
it
deans
groups
provide
senior
administrators
of
ischools
and
units
with
similarities
to
ischools
with
forums
to
share
structures
and
develop
common
norms
at
the
most
senior
administrative
level
one
outgrowth
of
this
is
the
rise
in
meetings
of
other
senior
academic
and
administrative
staff
such
as
research
deans
communications
and
various
common
degree
programs
there
are
at
least
two
aspects
of
self
replication
that
deserve
additional
attention
the
first
is
active
encouragement
towards
faculty
and
academic
leadership
of
other
universities
to
consider
starting
or
developing
ischools
there
are
likely
a
limited
number
of
universities
considering
starting
from
scratch
new
ischool
programs
and
there
are
relatively
few
programs
whose
histories
are
centered
in
library
and
information
science
who
have
not
begun
to
transit
towards
ischoollike
programs
since
these
two
paths
are
where
most
of
the
existing
ischools
drew
from
new
sources
of
growth
are
needed
the
most
likely
pathway
for
this
is
to
engage
colleagues
in
scholarly
fields
such
as
communications
and
computing
to
consider
becoming
more
ilike
other
possibilities
are
to
draw
information
systems
scholars
from
business
schools
as
some
senior
scholars
in
this
area
are
advocating
e
g
avison
and
eindor
the
second
aspect
of
selfreplication
deserving
more
attention
is
the
development
of
common
structures
and
norms
elements
of
a
shared
culture
again
there
is
some
progress
at
an
informal
level
for
example
many
of
the
current
ischools
and
particularly
those
who
have
histories
in
library
and
information
science
have
a
strong
humanistic
and
informational
perspective
other
currently
selfidentified
ischools
however
do
not
have
these
norms
as
deeplyingrained
still
others
are
developing
unique
sets
of
norms
the
various
mechanisms
for
having
ischool
faculty
and
administrative
leadership
get
together
provides
for
one
means
to
share
and
develop
common
structures
increasingly
however
this
attention
should
be
focusing
on
ensuring
that
these
structures
and
norms
are
part
of
the
undergraduate
and
graduate
training
and
education
and
for
institutional
legitimization
in
the
academy
graduate
students
are
often
seen
as
the
carriers
of
common
structures
and
norms
pursuing
selfregulation
autonomy
in
a
multidisciplinary
space
is
one
of
balance
to
maintain
multidisciplinarity
demands
both
development
of
a
common
core
of
knowledge
while
retaining
strong
ties
to
the
reference
or
contributing
scholarly
disciplines
without
a
common
core
the
space
is
ephemeral
a
collection
of
local
and
informal
interactions
with
no
permanence
without
strong
connection
to
reference
disciplines
the
space
becomes
an
orphan
and
is
too
easily
ignored
there
are
at
least
three
opportunities
before
ischool
members
to
increase
the
level
of
selfregulation
the
first
is
to
make
explicit
a
focus
on
building
ischool
faculties
whose
intellectual
heritage
combines
both
scholarly
training
from
outside
ischools
with
an
equal
commitment
to
hiring
ischooltrained
students
as
faculty
this
dual
strategy
provides
a
means
to
keep
the
ischools
connected
to
relevant
scholarly
disciplines
even
as
they
develop
a
core
interdisciplinary
structure
too
much
focus
on
internaltoischoolsfacultyhires
might
lead
to
where
the
collection
of
schools
becomes
selfreferential
disconnected
from
disciplines
and
ignored
too
great
a
focus
on
hiring
primarily
from
referent
disciplines
might
lead
to
where
no
sustaining
crossdisciplinary
interconnections
form
second
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
ischooltrained
graduate
students
secure
and
succeed
in
faculty
positions
in
the
reference
or
contributing
scholarly
disciplines
if
this
does
not
happen
then
the
special
sauce
of
interdisciplinary
scholarly
development
that
ischools
advocate
is
a
core
competency
becomes
moot
through
nonconsumption
third
there
should
be
more
effort
to
develop
future
administrative
leaders
from
within
ischools
currently
this
is
hard
given
the
limited
numbers
of
ischool
faculty
and
the
limited
opportunities
for
ischool
faculty
to
gain
administrative
experience
there
are
few
departments
in
the
few
programs
and
few
associate
dean
positions
meaning
it
is
relatively
difficult
to
develop
internaltoischool
candidate
pools
one
possibility
is
to
begin
holding
a
summer
institute
for
faculty
who
are
interested
in
pursuing
ischool
administration
this
institute
provides
a
means
for
faculty
from
outside
ischools
to
learn
more
about
these
scholarly
institutions
doing
this
provides
a
means
to
increase
the
pool
of
possible
leaders
expand
the
scale
and
support
selfreplication
activities
and
also
to
export
ischool
ideas
pursuing
structural
stability
structural
stability
reflects
both
a
commitment
by
members
to
pursue
collectively
a
common
set
of
core
issues
and
to
be
rewarded
for
doing
so
for
ischools
this
translates
into
developing
the
formal
and
informal
norms
that
recognize
and
reward
faculty
for
both
maintaining
a
strong
connection
to
research
communities
that
extend
beyond
ischools
into
reference
or
contributing
academic
disciplines
while
also
supporting
faculty
for
engaging
more
directly
particularly
with
colleagues
at
their
home
institution
in
disciplinecrossing
activities
these
norms
and
incentives
must
be
reflected
in
the
hiring
tenure
promotion
and
meritreview
processes
of
faculty
pursuing
visibility
visibility
means
having
a
coherent
outward
appearance
this
has
been
the
focus
of
the
ischool
caucus
and
academic
leadership
and
should
be
a
continued
focus
there
is
also
evidence
that
faculty
are
beginning
to
help
make
ischools
more
visible
for
example
the
ischools
and
ischool
faculty
are
very
involved
in
the
research
fields
of
humancomputer
interaction
hci
participatory
design
computersupported
cooperative
work
and
social
informatics
research
communities
this
involvement
leads
to
where
others
in
these
research
communities
and
particularly
younger
faculty
and
graduate
students
see
ischools
as
a
viable
if
not
preferred
choice
for
an
academic
home
the
evidence
suggests
that
ischool
faculty
and
administrative
leadership
are
making
steps
towards
becoming
a
scholarly
institution
the
need
for
collective
action
to
be
focused
and
to
pursue
the
efforts
needed
to
ensure
institutionalization
benefit
all
of
us
these
actions
also
demand

time
and
attention
