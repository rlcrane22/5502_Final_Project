a

judged
by
the
questions
it

that

critical

we
believe
that
profound
insight
will
only
come
through
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
intersection
among
human
beings
information
and
technology
we
see
the
basic
goal
of
our
field
as
helping
to
facilitate
interactions

groups
and

informeddesign
of

we
assume
that
human
beings
are
fundamentally
social
beings
andboth
information
and
technology
to
be
artifacts
of
human
experience
proffered
in
the
spirit
of
collaborating
we
begin
with
a
discussion
of
collaborating
and
communicating
behaviors
which
are
inherently
linguistic
broadly
cast
and
we
believe
by
definition
functional
in
nature
this
position
is
logically
prior
to
artifacts
or
any
technology
associated
with
the
creation
dissemination
storage
retrieval
or
other
processing
of
information
we
argue
for
example
that
it
is
insufficient
for
our
field
to
bounda
domain
after
artifacts
are
created
we
must
become
engaged
in
the
creation
of
artifacts
specifying
how
the
artifact
will
be
useful
to
the
user
either
at
present
or
in
the
future
and
for
which
problemssituations
the
artifact
is
pertinent
ifone
assumes

focused
on

not

result

profound
insights
into
the
human
condition

we
humbly
invite
you
to
collaborate
with
us
in
this
endeavor
we
feel
that
it
is
not
only
critical
to
intensify
this
discussion
but
both
timely
and
necessary
introduction
in
the
twelve
years
since
the
introduction
of
the
world
wide
web
april
we
have
seen
dramatic
changes
in
technology
that
have
allowed
for
a
plethora
of
collaborative
environments
and
new
means
for
communicating
to
emerge
this
in
turn
has
generated
a
plethora
of
new
artifacts
that
we
call
information
these
technological
artifacts
are
a
direct
result
of
specific
and
ubiquitous
human
behaviors
manifesting
themselves
in
seemingly
distinctive
ways
these
changes
increased
the
salience
of
a
set
of
formidable
andwe
arguedistinguishing
phenomena
our
field
is
now
addressing
this
paper
is
a
preliminary
attempt
to
reframe
the
discussion
about
our
broadly
cast
collective
research
agenda
around
these
phenomena
vannevar
bush
posited
the
ultimate
information
retrieval
mechanism
which
he
called
the
memex
memex
organized
content
in
a
collection
based
on
associative
indexing
in
his
view
associative
indexing
would
permit
retrieval
based
on
association
and
context
rather
than
strict
categorical
indexing
bushs
efforts
have
been
seen
as
the
conceptual
framework
for
subsequent
work
on
hypertext
which
is
the
central
data
metaphor
for
the
digital
age
we
view
this
as
a
good
example
of
a
technological
focus
absent
insights
into
human
or
user
behavior
for
example
bush
did
not
specify
the
nature
of
the
associations
among
nodes
in
the
hypertext
we
believe
that
functional
associations
between
what
information
is
about
and
how
the
information
might
help
a
user
is
a
logical
source
of
insight
into
bushs
associations
in
other
words
we
believe
that
the
source
of
the
association
that
bush
alluded
to
is
at
the
intersection
of
the
information
artifact
and
its
benefit
or
derived
use
the
purpose
of
this
paper
however
is
not
to
specifically
criticize
or
extend
bushs
ideas
or
to
recast
general
ideas
about
a
research
agenda
that
is
more
about
the
i
then
the
t
in
it
rather
we
wish
to
raise
the
question
of
whether
or
not
moving
the
focus
to
the
i
is
going
far
enough
to
define
our
field
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
lend
insight
into
fundamental
issues
like
those
brought
up
by
bush
over
ago
our
intent
is
to
explore
the
beginnings
of
a
coherent
conceptual
framework
that
is
derived
from
a
fundamental
understanding
of
what
leads
human
beings
to
collectively
create
use
and
reuse
our
experience
when
addressing
lifes
challenges
we
assume
that
these
collaborating
behaviors
are
fundamental
to
being
human
and
are
exhibited
by
people
communicating
experiences
and
understandings
with
each
other
these
fundamental
behaviors
inevitably
result
in
constructed
artifacts
that
are
necessarily
constrained
by
the
funtionality
of
technologies
designed
to
generate
access
and
disseminate
information
we
believe
that
the
ifield
is
uniquely
positioned
and
capable
of
gaining
profound
insight
into
these
fundamental
behaviors
only
if
we
adopt
a
truly
interdisciplinary
stance
that
incorporates
the
i
the
t
and
the
h
i
e
the
human
being
when
trying
to
understand
the
whys
and
hows
of
creating
using
and
reusing
information
in
a
recent
article
which
surveys
the
two
seemingly
definitive
areas
of
information
science
exemplified
by
the
journal
of
the
american
society
for
information
science
and
technology
and
information
systems
exemplified
by
the
journal
of
information
systems
research
sawyer
and
huang
put
forth
the
following
we
speculate
that
scholars
in
information
systems
research
need
to
be
more
explicit
about
its
basic
constructs
even
to
the
simple
level
of
articulating
the
range
of
possible
ways
to
characterize
these
basic
constructs
to
more
easily
connect
to
and
to
be
understood
by
other
disciplines
sawyer
huang
sawyer
and
huang
seek
to
find
common
ground
among
researchers
within
the
fields
of
information
science
and
information
systems
their
purpose
is
to
gain
some
insight
into
how
scholars
might
increase
collaboration
both
within
and
between
fields
additionally
they
are
interested
in
better
understanding
how
to
build
bridges
between
these
fields
and
others
we
believe
that
their
interest
in
gaining
insight
into
these
collaborating
behaviors
actually
illustrates
the
basic
constructs
they
seek
we
do
not
view
this
as
a
coincidence
given
they
are
is
researchers
who
have
positioned
themselves
within
the
larger
ifield
which
we
view
as
being
composed
ofat
leastinformation
science
information
systems
and
library
science
researchers
we
posit
that
those
who
view
themselves
as
being
tied
to
the
ifield
share
a
common
interest
in
collaborating
behaviors
and
technologies
that
support
these
behaviors
see
how
we
define
our
broad
use
of
the
term
collaborating
below
and
that
these
interests
converge
on
phenomena
associated
with
these
behaviors
that
characterize
the
field
it
seems
that
it
is
an
interest
in
these
phenomena
and
these
technologies
from
which
all
inquiries
into
the
it
artifact
it
per
se
individual
social
or
organizational
processes
representation
retrieval
transfer
etc
emerge
we
suggest
that
the
increase
in
the
salience
of
these
characterizing
phenomena
are
a
direct
result
of
using
technology
to
communicate
and
collaborate
at
all
levels
of
an
increasingly
intertwined
global
environment
further
we
suggest
that
one
of
the
profound
impacts
of
it
is
not
derived
merely
from
its
wide
scale
adoption
but
from
the
resultant
increase
in
salience
of
collaborating
behaviors
embedded
within
every
social
environment
for
example
we
are
now
able
to
point
directly
to
a
set
of
artifacts
e
g
emails
im
messages
blogs
etc
written
by
various
individuals
who
are
collaborating
to
solve
a
specific
problem
and
validly
view
it
as
evidence
of
a
team
or
community
yet
not
a
single
facetoface
interaction
among
their
members
is
required
before
doing
so
those
within
the
ifield
are
uniquely
positioned
to
explain
why
this
characterization
is
valid
and
why
it
can
be
reliably
made
across
all
contexts
in
which
humans
interact
most
importantly
this
brings
the
field
beyond
explaining
how
or
why
technology
enables
this
type
of
human
interactionexplanations
that
are
seemingly
selfevident
to
many
simply
because
it
is
becoming
embedded
in
peoples
daily
lives
and
business
process
in
other
words
the
fascination
with
technology
is
fading
and
potentially
turning
more
towards
an
expectation
of
more
connectivity
beyond
the
i
and
certainly
the
t
we
believe
that
it
has
worked
to
illuminate
who
we
are
as
humans
and
that
the
emergence
of
the
ifield
is
a
direct
result
of
a
common
interest
in
this
it
is
insight
into
who
we
are
as
a
field
that
will
create
the
gravitating
effect
discussed
by
sawyer
and
huang
uniquely
define
what
it
means
to
be
a
researcher
in
the
ifield
to
those
in
other
fields
as
well
as
the
world
and
lead
to
better
design
of
systems
and
technology
e
g
organizing
artifacts
according
to
bushs
notion
of
associative
indexing
which
will
in
turn
enable
those
in
the
field
to
have
a
more
profound
impact
on
the
world
let
alone
other
disciplines
our
field
has
dedicated
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energy
examining
content
and
its
technology
in
the
last
fifteen
years
but
we
believe
that
we
must
commit
significant
resources
into
understanding
human
beings
and
their
behavior
from
a
more
functional
and
purer
userbased
perspective
this
perspective
differs
from
those
of
many
other
fields
focused
solely
on
behaviorand
potentially
viewed
as
being
focused
on
the
user
as
well
e
g
those
within
the
psychological
economical
and
political
science
fieldsby
viewing
the
user
as
an
active
and
creative
participant
who
is
actually
working
towards
constructing
their
environment
as
opposed
to
a
more
passive
participant
merely
reacting
to
their
environment
we
are
certainly
not
alone
in
this
view
e
g
dervin
nilan
saracevic
sawyer
huang
there
are
many
ways
to
reframe
our
research
agenda
one
is
to
conceptualize
the
artifacts
that
we
call
information
as
byproducts
of
various
attempts
by
human
beings
to
collaborate
and
share
experiences
with
each
other
some
already
under
way
include
applying
predigital
solutions
to
digital
content
e
g
meta
language
classification
of
web
pages
others
are
uniquely
digital
solutions
e
g
natural
language
processing
for
filtering
and
still
others
are
a
blend
of
the
predigital
and
digital
e
g
folksonomies
we
offer
a
perspective
that
has
emerged
out
of
a
juxtaposition
of
the
socalled
userbased
cognitive
and
social
cognitive
approaches
nilan
deredita
deredita
nilan
and
believe
that
it
also
works
to
illustrate
the
focus
of
inquiry
discussed
above
what
follows
is
strictly
an
illustration
of
how
we
frame
our
research
within
the
ifield
as
discussed
above
it
is
important
to
note
that
we
do
not
view
the
perspective
we
put
forth
below
as
exemplary
of
the
ifield
we
believe
that
the
common
ground
we
share
with
all
ifield
researchers
is
in
our
overarching
assumption
of
an
active
user
and
our
interest
in
collaborating
behaviors
and
how
to
realize
the
potential
of
it
to
support
these
behaviors
it
is
from
our
interest
in
collaborating
behaviors
that
we
believe
we
can
begin
a
dialogue
with
any
researcher
considered
to
be
part
of
the
ifield
as
well
as
those
who
are
not
below
we
put
forth
the
foundation
of
our
research
on
collaborating
behaviors
we
differentiate
ourselves
from
other
researchers
within
the
field
by
relating
information
to
human
collaborating
about
specific
situations
or
problems
discussed
below
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
our
anchoring
curiosity
in
specific
types
of
collaborating
behaviors
allows
us
a
linguist
and
cognitive
psychologist
by
trade
to
work
in
a
complementary
and
fulfilling
manner
from
our
perspective
our
home
disciplines
only
add
perspective
to
the
more
important
common
phenomena
in
which
we
are
interested
in
gaining
insight
it
is
in
the
spirit
of
collaborating
that
we
present
this
paper
our
primary
motivation
is
to
see
if
others
are
able
to
frame
their
research
within
a
field
focused
on
all
aspects
of
human
collaborating
behaviors
we
begin
by
defining
key
terms
relevant
to
our
own
research
agenda
but
seemingly
relevant
to
a
number
of
others
as
well
we
then
discuss
how
our
agenda
has
and
continues
to
unfold
over
time
and
how
it
relates
back
to
the
ifieldspecific
themes
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
the
paper
given
our
discussion
above
about
the
field
we
continue
with
some
discussion
on
the
nature
of
our
inquiry
into
collaborative
behaviors
in
order
to
give
a
sense
of
the
flavor
of
our
discussion
our
anchoring
definitions
collaborating
is
the
social
coordination
largely
communicative

which
human

their

their

there
is
much
that

it

that

renders
any

necessarily
incomplete
similarly
technological
artifacts
are
necessarily
incomplete
expressions
of
context
and
therefore
inadequate
representations
of
the

from
the
perspective
of
either
person
involved
this
in
turn
presents
a
difficulty
when
we
seek
to
access
and
reuse
the
artifacts
especially
when
they
are
located
in
a
huge
pile
of
other
inadequate
representations
note
that
we
can
posit
a
continuum
of
information
artifacts
from
an
artifact
addressing
how
to
make
a
chocolate
cake
for
example
where
there
may
be
many
possible
contexts
where
a
chocolate
cake
is
appropriate
to
an
artifact
addressing
the
nature
of
alzheimers
disease
where
the
help
needed
by
a
patient
is
likely
to
be
different
than
the
help
needed
by
a
relative
of
the
patient
in
neither
case
is
the
users
context
likely
to
be
present
in
the
information
artifact
itselfalbeit
a
seemingly
more
profound
issue
in
the
case
of
alzheimers
disease
cognitive
movement
is
a
central
metaphor
in
dervins
sensemaking
which
is
employed
to
describe
the
human
experience
of
being
alive
over
time
in
this
metaphor
experiencing
life
is
described
as
taking
steps
mentally
as
well
as
perhaps
physically
through
problemssituations
sometimes
concurrently
although
not
simultaneously
or
serially
cognitive
movement
invariably
implies
emotive
steps
cognitive
movement
is
one
of
two
central
concepts
in
the
userbased
approach
we
put
forth
in
this
paper
it
is
inseparably
tied
to
the
concept
of
problemsituation
uncertainty
carter
refers
to
the
aspects
of
an
individuals
or
individuals
perceptions
of
a
problemsituation
that
are
not
already
predetermined
since
change
in
self
others
environment
and
problemsituation
is
pervasive
uncertainty
is
always
except
with
reflexive
and
habitual
behavior
an
aspect
of
human
perception
dervin
refers
to
a
gap
to
represent
the
uncertainty
inherent
in
an
individuals
perception
of
herhis
position
relative
to
that
individuals
movement
through
the
situationproblem
context
at
hand
when
uncertainty
is
perceived
by
the
individual
she
can
attempt
to
resolve
the
uncertainty
by
sharing
meaning
or
creating
meaning
through
collaborating
with
others
either
directly
through
conversation
or
indirectly
through
artifacts
of
past
conversations
from
a
monadic
perspective
meaning
describes
the
sense
that
an
individual
makes
of
aspects
of
the
environment
inherent
in
her
perception
of
her
problemsituation
in
terms
of
her
understanding
of
the
environment
andor
her
movement
relative
to
that
environment
to
reach
her
goal
or
end
state
this
meaning
is
based
on
past
experience
and
certainly
based
on
past
and
present
conversations
with
others
either
direct
or
vicarious
in
this
way
meaning
can
be
seen
as
the
creation
of
new
sense
dervin
about
how
to
bridge
the
gap
i
e
addressing
uncertainty
it
can
also
be
seen
as
the
creative
reinterpretation
of
old
meaning
to
fit
new
situational
conditions
although
meaning
is
created
directly
by
experiencing
a
problemsituation
experience
can
also
be
vicarious
experienced
indirectly
through
observing
others
a
dyadic
or
larger
model
of
sense
making
can
help
to
guide
our
efforts
because
the
observing
of
others
experiences
and
behaviors
is
realized
through
conversing
with
others
about
the
specific
context
given
specific
comments
such
comments
are
rare
in
most
formal
artifacts
but
comprise
the
bulk
of
the
verbiage
in
a
conversation
see
yoon
nilan
this
has
become
even
more
evident
in
our
digital
post
web
world
from
birth
individuals
are
enmeshed
in
a
collaborative
network
of
others
who
attempt
to
help
the
individuals
observe
and
move
effectively
through
collaborative
communicating
all
communicating
is
through
language
grounded
in
individual
experience
direct
or
vicarious
and
meaning
is
created
by
the
similarities
and
differences
among
individual
experiences
much
meaning
some
i
e
structural
views
e
g
giddens
bordieu
would
say
all
meaning
is
perpetuated
over
time
through
pervasive
structurational
e
g
historical
cultural
constraint
and
extended
experience
with
a
situationproblem
or
group
of
related
situationsproblems
note
communicating
does
not
necessarily
result
in
the
rare
phenomenon
of
communication
carter
so
communicating
only
implies
the
attempt
to
share
experience
and
orientation
not
the
result
one
point
of
the
foregoing
is
that
explicit
comments
in
an
artifact
which
is
much
more
likely
in
a
conversation
than
a
formal
publishing
or
broadcasting
artifact
allow
a
subsequent

to
quickly
determine
whether
the

the

in

deredita

the

of

is
episodic

personal

acquired

is
no

in

experience
results
from
the
construction

relating
of

but
does
not
necessarily
result
in

intended

the
proliferation
of

within
a
social
context
e

dyad

is
the

construct

logan
defines
an
episode
as
follows
processing
episodes
consist
of
the

the

to
attain
the

in
pursuit
of

goal
the

given
to

with
respect
to
the

and
the
response
made
to
the

logan
to
paraphrase
logans
quote
in
dervins
terms
making
sense
of
a
situation
involves
the
goal
or
end
state
that
the
individual
has
in
mind
the
situational
conditions
as
perceived
and
interpreted
by
the
individual
as
she
moves
through
the
situation
and
the
cognitive
behaviors
especially
those
that
serve
to
collaborate
and
to
communicate
with
others
that
the
individual
takes
to
move
towards
hisher
goal
this
entire
chunk
of
time
and
space
i
e
episode
is
the
context
which
is
the
central
focus
of
userbased
research
put
forth
in
this
paper
that
we
do
this
by
collaborating
and
communicating
via
language
with
others
implies
that
the
constructed
meaning
is
tied
to
social
cognitive
behaviors
among
individuals
this
is
very
similar
to
sensemaking
from
the
perspective
of
carl
weick
albeit
more
specific
the
process
of
sensemaking
is
intended
to
include
the
construction
and
bracketing
of
the
textlike
cues
that
are
interpreted
as
well
as
the
revision
of
those
interpretations
based
on
action
and
its
consequences
sensemaking
is
about
authoring
as
well
as
interpretation
creation
as
well
as
discovery
weick
overlap
among
episodes
allows
for
a
stream
of
discrete
episodes
to
result
in
a
seemingly
fluid
flow
of
experience
we
would
not
be
able
to
make
sense
of
our
experiences
if
this
was
not
true
weick
for
example
deredita
and
barreto
suggest
the
following
a
new
episode
might
be
associated
individually
and
collectively
with
previous
episodes
because
of
similar
qualities
as
defined
above
that
there
is
some
type
of
incongruity
results
in
the
most
obvious
need
for
sensemaking
weick
it
presents
the
need
for
constructing
a
potentially
unique
episode
that
is
congruent
enough
for
it
to
be
associated
with
past
episodes
or
for
it
to
make
sense
this
is
not
an
abstraction
but
a
direct
comparison
made
through
humancognitive
behaviors

are
explicitly
related
or
not
explicitly
related
in
some
manner
in
the
latter
case
previous
episodes
however
most
likely
continue
to
indirectly
influence
behavior
whether
individuals
are
aware
of
this
influence
or
not
reder
on
the
other
hand
a
new
episode
might
reinforce
a
previous
experience
because
of
similar
qualities
here
one
can
assume
a
high
probability
that
newly
constructed
episodes
will
be
related
to
past
episodes
unlike
the
previous
case
the
amount
of
effort
required
to
make
sense
of
an
episode
is
minimal
thus
allowing
for
specific
stimulusresponse
behavior
to
be
optimally
reinforced
wyer
a
new
episode
might
also
fall
between
the
two
extremes
this
is
perhaps
the
gray
area
in
which
one
is
said
to
rely
upon
previous
experience
with
similar
episodes
situationsproblems
referenced
by
nonaka
and
takeuchi
in
their
view
of
tacit
knowledge
here
one
is
simply
afforded
the
chance
to
do
less
sensemaking
than
in
the
first
case
presented
while
also
being
able
to
leverage
an
array
of
previous
episodes
that
are
functionally
or
not
similar
in
quality
note
that
bordieus
notion
of
habitus
can
help
us
understand
scenarios
two

three
above
habitus
refers
to
familiarity
with
a

such
that
the

a

set
of

emerges
if
we

is
the

may
be

in

them
representative

deredita
and

this
leads
us
to
assume
the
following
in
regard
to
episodes
ergo
experience
see
deredita
and
barreto
for
a
more
complete
discussion
on
these
assumptions
which
are
a
juxtaposition
of
assumptions
from
a
perspective
representative
of
the
field
of
cognitive
psychology
particularly
that
of
logan
with
that
of
an
ifield
perspective
the
constructing
and
relating
of
experience
is
episodic
each
episode
is
associated
with
one
or
more
previous
episodes
but
is
constructed
as
a
separate
cooccurrence
constructing
new
episodes
is
obligatory
upon
attention
that
which
is
attended
to
is
automatically
perceived
and
embedded
within
the
context
of
a
given
episode
relating
to
previous
episodes
is
obligatory
upon
attention
previous
experience
directly
impacts
behavior
if
a
current
situational
condition
is
attended
to
and
is
associated
with
previous
episodes
in
some
way
memory
refers
to
the
ability
of
human
beings
to
associate
present
situational
conditions
with
perceptions
of
past
situational
conditions
relative
to
the
current
episode
the
associating
is
not
exact
so
we
see
limitations
in
the
objectiveness
of
human
memory
and
we
certainly
should
consider
the
individuals
criteria
employed
for
associating
as
inexact
the
extent
to
which
the
associating
is
based
on
habitus
or
inherited
criteria
and
logic
represents
increased
likelihood
that
associations
made
for
evolving
uncertainty
in
situational
conditions
in
the
present
and
future
will
not
be
up
to
the
task
it
is
important
to
note
that
while
our
perspective
is
cognitively
slanted
our
notion
of
episode
given
its
relationship
to
problemsituation
applies
to
context
and
both
individual
and
social
behavior
it
is
at
this
point
in
which
weif
we
have
yet
to
do
soradically
diverge
from
traditional
cognitive
theory
we
further
diverge
by
suggesting
that
any
notion
of
storage
in
relation
to
memory
is
misleading
our
epistemological
stance
places
the
individual
in
the
present
and
notions
of
past
and
futurethus
timeas
cognitive
constructs
that
facilitate
sensemaking
from
a
functional
perspective
simply
put
we
are
not
comfortable
assuming
the
world
is
as
it
seems
to
be
but
rather
how
the
world
seems
to
be
is
functionally
similar
to
how
it
is
we
assume
that
the
nexus
of
the
cognitive
behaviors
described
above
is
that
of
a
neurological
functioning
organthe
brain
the
physical
foundation
from
which
more
abstract
cognizing
emerges
is
assumed
to
be
in
a
constant
state
of
change
as
it
interacts
with
the
world
it
is
because
of
this
that
we
see
no
need
to
accept
notions
of
memory
like
that
adopted
from
a
computerbased
informationprocessing
perspective
while
we
assume
experience
is
bounded
in
the
episodic
manner
discussed
above
and
that
each
episode
is
processed
as
separate
cooccurrence
we
do
not
assume
that
these
episodes
are
stored
in
this
manner
waiting
to
be
retrieved
or
recalled
at
a
latter
time
we
view
behavior
as
resulting
from
cognitive
behaviors
that
have
been
shaped
by
previous
experience
and
as
a
response
to
a
given
problem
given
its
and
an
individuals
andor
groups
state
at
a
specific
point
in
time
and
space
further
we
do
not
assume
behavior
to
be
deterministic
albeit
potentially
implied
given
what
has
been
said
thus
far
we
view
behavior
as
being
tied
to
experience
in
a
probabilistic
manner
and
to
current
constraints
imposed
by
ones
interpretation
of
the
problem
which
is
also
relatively
uncertain
and
probabilistic
in
nature
more
experience
implies
that
the
individual

has
a
better
chance
of
usefully

functionally
choosing

the

experts
as
the
ones
who
can
most
effectively
and
efficiently
respond
to
a
specific
problem
by
choosing
or
creating
appropriate
steps
however
experience
is
based
on
past
uncertainty
rather
than
present
or
future
uncertainty
this
past
orientation
may
potentially
limit
the
expert
in
dealing
effectively
and
efficiently
with
emerging
new
situational
conditions
creativity
refers
to
an
individual
perceiving
or
taking
steps
that
are
beyond
hisher
existing
direct

vicariously
inherited

with
the

at

it
is
different
from
a
judgment
made
externally
e
g
a
creative
work
given
the
necessary
association
with
the

we
view
creativity
as
being
best
conceptualized
as
a
timespace
bound
cognitive
behavior
rather
than
a

characteristic
of

the
issue
for

a
field
we
seek
to
create
or
discover
patterns
that
serve
to
guide
our
organization
of
resources
which
in
turn
must
guide
information
seekers
in
locating
resources
for
subsequent
reuse
we
argue
that
patterns
which
are
derived
from
the
technological
artifacts
as
we
find
them
are
ineffective
in
facilitating
either
appropriate
levels
of
agreement
in
classification
of
artifacts
or
retrieval
by
users
who
we
know
wont
read
the
manual
the
technology
that
produces
the
artifacts
provides
no
insight
into
the
logic
of
this
organizingretrieving
endeavor
whatsoever
it
is
a
human
behavior
that
ultimately
dictates
the
function
of
any
organizational
scheme
therefore
to
the
extent
to
which
we
can
find
patterns
i
e
similar
actions
and
sequences
of
actions
rationales
values
descriptions
behaviors
etc
in
the
way
people
collaborate
and
communicate
about
their
problemssituations
we
can
examine
these
patterns
to
see
if
they
can
be
employed
effectively
for
the
organizing
and
subsequent
retrieval
of
artifacts
there
is
some
evidence
that
indeed
they
can
be
so
employed
e
g
nilan
yoon
nilan
nilan
mundkur
we
argue
that
these
same
patterns
may
be
suitable
for
organizing
nontraditional
resources
that
our
current
approaches
to
the
organizing
retrieval
dilemma
do
not
accommodate
e
g
maps
images
people
places
etc
after
all
these
patterns
represent
the
universal
habitus
of
human
survival
through
collaborating
and
communicating
which
is
far
older
than
the
mere
years
since
the
invention
of
writing
and
the
patterns
e
g
between
topic
and
comment
or
between
one
step
and
the
next
step
represent
associations
readily
interpretable
to
users
further
we
believe
that
our
functional
understanding
of
these
patterns
will
serve
to
inform
our
disciplinary
design
of
systems
and
technology
so
that
we
can
facilitate
the
organizing
and
retrieving
of
artifacts
as
those
artifacts
are
generated
note
that
constraints
associated
with
design
should
be
viewed
as
necessarily
balanced
between
enabling
naturaland
potentially
idiosyncratichuman
behavior
and
guidelines
for
effective
creation
and
exchange
of
meaning
through
information
for
example
email
currently
has
only
to
from
and
subject
fields
as
yoon
nilan
suggested
these
might
be
augmented
with
comment
fields
such
as
how
the
email
will
help
the
recipient
understand
hisher
problem
better
and
or
how
the
email
will
help
the
recipient
figure
out
what
to
do
at
this
time
andor
why
this
email
is
important
to
the
recipient
the
focus
in
this
example
is
on
comment
and
therefore
the
functional
associations
between
users
views
of
reality
and
their
movement
through
that
reality
this
kind
of
association
between
topic
and
comment
represents
one
fairly
concrete
association
of
potentially
many
possible
that
might
enable
our
field
to
actually
guide
the
generation
of
artifacts
that
incorporate
bushs
associative
indexing
as
the
artifacts
are
generated
we
believe
that
in
this
way
our
discipline
could
lead
insightful
changes
to
relatively
ubiquitous
technologies
that
would
serve
subsequent
organizing
and
retrieving
again
this
relatively
small
change
would
be
based
on
insight
into
the
fundamental
collaborating
behaviors
discussed
above
and
not
the
technology
per
se
turning
an
agenda
into
action
while
we
emphasize
creation
use
and
reuse
of
experiences
above
here
we
will
focus
on
only
the
latter
two
but
with
the
assumption
that
all
that
is
discussed
below
is
directly
applicable
to
the
design
of
systems
specifically
focused
on
the
creating
of
information
two
courses
of
action
are
suggested
in
regard
to
use
and
reuse
by
the
foregoing
the
first
is
to
generate
rich
descriptions
of
the
communitybased
communicating
behaviors
and
subsequent
cognitive
behaviors
i
e
perceptions
and
step
taking
of
the
individual
community
members
to
search
for
patterns
the
second
is
based
on
these
rich
descriptions
apply
our
fieldspecific
experiencehabitus
proactively
to
facilitate
the
direct
communicating
behaviors
and
at
the
same
time
facilitate
the
effective
and
efficient
use
and
reuse
of
vicarious
experience
since
systems
including
classification
organization
of
artifacts
have
been
defined
above
as
a
series
of
steps
designed
to
solve
a
human
problem
empirically
derived
patterns
will
inform
us
as
to
the
selection
of
appropriate
steps
and
sequences
of
steps
we
see
these
patterns
as
superlative
examples
of
associative
dimensions
alluded
to
by
bush
based
on
this
change
in
focus
the
following
userbased
and
problemsituationbased
research
agenda
is
proposed
for
the
study
of
collaborative
behaviors
within
communities
but
with
the
assumption
that
a
similar
approach
can
be
applied
to
for
example
teams
first
we
would
seek
to
describe
behaviors
within
the
collaborative
communities
that
punctuate
human
lives
intracommunity
rich
descriptions
of
the
communicating
and
collaborating
behaviors
not
merely
perusal
of
existing
technological
artifacts
which
are
by
definition
meaningchallenged
inandofthemselves
and
their
rationales
i
e
both
topic
and
comment
can
be
examined
for
evidence
of
patterns
in
effective
andor
efficient
behaviors
steps
sets
of
behaviors
e
g
roles
but
not
as
characteristics
of
individuals
as
functional
sequences
and
reward
structures
and
constraints
that
facilitate
communicating
and
therefore
collaborating
part
of
our
disciplinary
confusion
visvis
these
behaviors
are
like
a
fish
in
water
scenario
we
are
embedded
in
social
interaction
and
therefore
find
it
quite
difficult
to
posit
the
behaviors
as
an
object
of
inquiry
we
believe
it
to
be
an
imperative
initial
focus
of
inquiry
the
flexibility
of
notion
of
community
is
particularly
useful
here
because
it
would
allow
researchers
to
tailor
their
observations
to
groups
with
limited
ranges
of
problemssituations
e
g
specific
organizations
or
organizations
focused
on
providing
similar
products
or
services
this
in
turn
would
allow
us
to
pursue
a
basic
research
agenda
into
our
primary
phenomena
and
provide
concrete
practical
insight
into
the
targeted
communities
as
we
pursue
our
rich
descriptions
community
as
a
unit
of
analysis
will
facilitate
many
analyses
across
different
communities
to
get
at
the
essence
of
human
communicating
and
collaborating
as
well
as
experiment
with
various
artifact
creation
possibilities
we
can
subsequently
examine
similar
phenomena
in
the
communicating
among
communities
of
particular
interest
here
is
referrals
from
one
community
discussion
to
another
when
under
what
conditions
etc
given
the
horizontal
communication
engendered
by
the
web
we
believe
that
insight
into
this
specific
subset
collaborative
behaviors
will
be
particularly
useful
for
many
information
seeking
scenarios
in
the
digital
age
once
we
have
adequately
described
these
phenomena
and
looked
for
relationships
among
behaviors
and
various
use
criteria
our
collective
understanding
of
the
human
perquisites
inherent
in
creating
using
and
reusing
others
experiences
we
can
then
become
proactively
engaged
in
research
and
design
of
the
actual
production
of
artifacts
which
incorporate
these
efficiencies
to
facilitate
appropriate
vicarious
reuse
of
the
documented
experience
e
g
adding
fields
to
emailvoicemailtexting
interfaces
this
will
in
turn
facilitate
subsequent
reuse
of
the
technological
artifacts
in
more
of
a
conversational
manner
as
opposed
to
the
current
topical
keyword
strategy
we
believe
this
kind
of
search
interface
e
g
specify
topic
and
then
specify
comments
plural
employed
here
is
deliberate
will
be
more
natural
for
the
large
majority
of
users
with
no
manual
or
knowledge
of
boolean
logic
necessary
in
essence
this
is
what
yoon
nilan
suggested
the
organization
of
resources
both
communicative
and
artifactual
within
and
between
problemsituationbased
communities
over
the
currently
unimaginably
huge
hypertext
data
store
of
artifacts
that
tomorrows
web
will
contain
we
believe
that
this
communicativecollaborative
framework
will
facilitate
the
sharing
of
resources
within
and
among
communities
and
ultimately
facilitate
the
effectiveefficient
access
of
individuals
to
the
communities
which
best
fit
their
individual
problemssituations
whether
or
not
you
subscribe
to
bushs
memex
vision
the
potential
power
of
his
associational
indexing
to
manage
inherently
unmanageably
huge
data
set
seems
logically
possible
if
we
posit
the
associating
as
an
extension
of
how
human
beings
help
each
other
make
sense
of
and
move
through
the
sequence
of
situationsproblems
that
punctuate
their
experiences
our
position
is
that
meaning
is
a
product
of
human
beings
actively
experiencing
the
world
as
they
move
through
time
and
space
as
inherently
social
creatures
we
attempt
to
share
meaning
linguistically
broadly
cast
and
generate
artifacts
through
various
technologies
either
as
part
of
our
communicatingcollaborating
with
others
or
as
an
attempt
to
share
meaning
with
another
in
the
future
who
is
in
a
similar
situation
or
has
a
similar
problem
the
artifacts
are
what
we
call
information
we
believe
that
a
useful
way
if
not
the
most
useful
way
to
organize
large
numbers
of
such
artifacts
lies
in
the
association
between
the
active
human
being
hisher
problemsituation
and
goal
or
envisioned
end
state
and
a
cocollaborator
either
in
the
present
or
in
an
envisioned
future
in
conclusion
the
internet
and
more
specifically
the
web
has
changed
the
functional
definition
of
community
by
illustrating
the
collapse
of
the
geographicalspatial
constraint
on
communicating
community
implies
an
organizing
principle
more
intimately
tied
to
the
problemsituation
than
to
a
person
or
a
set
of
people
per
se
which
has
resulted
in
a
multitude
of
virtual
communities
that
are
more
narrowly
focused
on
the
range
of
problemssituations
that
define
them
along
the
way
the
web
has
also
spawned
a
multitude
of
types
of
artifacts
what
our
field
calls
information
that
come
in
a
seemingly
increasing
number
of
unpredictable
forms
our
inherited
logic
so
far
at
least
seemingly
lacks
the
necessary
coherency
for
the
managing
of
these
artifacts
another
way
to
describe
the
internet
and
its
multimedia
offspring
the
web
is
the
removal
of
many
hierarchical
or
topdown
constraints
both
in
terms
of
the
means
of
production
la
marx
and
in
terms
of
centralized
organizationalpolitical
control
the
web
would
seem
to
be
inherently
unmanageable
this
has
resulted
in
an
immense
and
rapid
increase
in
the
total
volume
of
various
types
of
artifacts
this
will
continue
as
various
means
by
which
people
collaborate
freely
develop
and
evolve
this
makes
accurately
predicting
new
ways
of
collaborating
and
what
is
created
in
terms
of
resultant
artifacts
very
difficult
we
would
argue
impossible
however
the
constant
of
fundamental
human
behaviors
will
remain
they
will
be
manifested
in
different
technological
ways
yet
potentially
be
more
exposed
than
ever
before
the
ifield
is
seemingly
the
only
community
seeking
profound
insight
into
these
behaviors
through
the
lens
that
technology
offersalbeit
not
formally
so
we
argue
in
this
paper
that
anchoring
ourselves
in
a
constantly
shifting
bed
of
technology
and
artifacts
will
not
lead
to
stability
or
necessarily
profound
insight
into
either
of
these
yet
the
proliferation
of
ways
to
communicate
and
resultant
artifacts
continues
this
is
why
we
believe
a
more
focused
and
solidified
agenda
for
the
ifield
based
on
fundamental
human
behaviors
is
not
only
timely
