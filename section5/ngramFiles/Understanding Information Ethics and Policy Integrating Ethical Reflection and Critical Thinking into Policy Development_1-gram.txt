ethics
as
reflection
on
morality
is
widely
accepted
among
philosopher
beginning
with
aristotle
the
founder
of
ethics
as
an
academic
discipline
as
rafael
capurro
who
heads
the
international

icie
reminds
us
as
a

ethics
is
an

of
the
moral
code
that
is
to

of

to
individual

social
communication
in
other
words
ethics
observes
the
ways
we
communicate
with
each
other
as
moral
persons
and
the
ways
this
moral
identify
is
understood
there
is
indeed
no
unbiased
ethical
observer
in
the
rapidly
changing
environments
in
which
information
professionals
work
and
in
which
ischool
educators
teach
ethical
issues
are
increasingly
being
raised
demanding
attention
and
efforts
toward
resolution
of
particular
interest
for
ischools
and
the
information
field
are
those
related
to
information
throughout
its
lifecycle
originally
called
the
ethics
of
information
in
society
this
topic
has
more
commonly
been
referred
to
as
information
ethics
ie
beginning
in
conferences
on
the
ethics
of
electronic
information
in
the
st
century
were
held
at
the
university
memphis
the
subject
of
ie
has
also
gained
international
interest
as
demonstrated
by
recent
activities
starting
with
the
first
unesco
conference
of
infoethics
in
in
an
invitational
conference
was
held
in
karlsruhe

of

many
professional
associations
in
the
information
field
have
had
codes
of
ethics
for
years
and
the
association
for

information
science
education
alise
recently
established
a
taskforce
to
develop
a
code
of
ethics
for
alise
with
a
report
due
at
its
annual
conference
in
january
the
topic
of
information
ethics
has
been
addressed
in
the
literature
with
an
annual
review
of
the
literature
on
the
topic
first
appearing
in
the
annual
review
of
information
science
and
technology
in
over
the
past
nearly
years
several
ischools
have
incorporated
information
ethics
into
their
curricula
both
as
standalone
courses
and
as
part
of
other
courses
many
of
which
are
required
core
courses
ie
education
at
pitts
ischool
in
the
school
introduced
a
lecture
series
on
the
ethics
of
information
in
society
to
help
in
shaping
the
information
ethics
course
that
was
introduced
the
following
year
the
course
seeks
to
provide
a
background
to
applied
ethics
as
a
prelude
to
learning
the
skills
of
ethical
decisionmaking
and
then
to
applying
those
skills
to
the
real
and
current
challenges
of
the
information
profession
the
scope
of
the
coursework
and
discussions
includes
decisionmaking
and
challenges
related
to
information
sources
and
services
in
all
formats
and
media
to
the
internet
and
other
digital
sources
cyber

and
to

topics
in

the
objectives
of
the
course
described
as
what
students
will
be
expected
to
have
at
the
completion
of
the
course
are
developed
a
better
understanding
of
themselves
in
the
ongoing
endeavor
to
know
thyself
learned
how
to
identify
an
issue
reflect
on
it
which
is
ethics
and
make
a
decision
that
is
moral
engaged
in
reflective
thinking
and
careful
choice
of
words
which
result
in
civil
discourse
developed
an
understanding
of
the
art
and
science
of
applied
ethics
as
related
to
the
main
challenges
currently
confronting
the
information
profession
the
course
is
not
a
philosophy
or
religion
course
but
instead
concentrates
on
the
application
of
ethical
reasoning
to
the
information
profession
with
its
many
diverse
specializations
it
is
divided
into
three
main
sections
an
introduction
to
applied
ethics
the
necessary
steps
for
facing
up
to
and
resolving
a
moral
dilemma
and
making
a
decision
and
ethical
issues
in
our
field
the
approach
combines
knowing
how
with
knowing
why
and
concentrates
on
the
many
questions
to
be
asked
in
resolving
complex
issues
beginning
with
the
individual
it
is
about
each
of
us
as
an
individual
even
though
it
is
often
easier
to
think
of
someone
elses
ethics
and
also
relates
to
interactions
with
other
components
of
life
e
g
the
environment
animals
etc
the
importance
of
the
relationship
between
one
individual
and
another
and
the
need
to
learn
to
understand
that
each
of
us
is
a
human
worthy
of
respect
that
we
are
fundamentally
the
same
is
stressed
the
initial
assignment
is
for
students
to
read
and
reflect
on
the
u
n
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
and
martin
luther
kings
i
have
a
dream
speech
and
to
write
a
short
paper
on
the
fundamental
moral
experience
they
then
identify
a
personal
problem
or
issue
whether
related
to
personal
or
professional
life
and
work
throughout
the
course
towards
solution
of
the
problem
for
the
course
the
definition
of
ethics
used
is
ethics
is
the
art
and
science
that
seeks
to
bring
sensitivity
and
method
to
the
discernment
of
moral
values
stephen
almagno
and
toni
carbo
students
read
a
series
of
books
and
articles
which
change
over
time
and
are
drawn
from
a
number
of
disciplines
including
philosophy
library
and
information
science
business
and
many
others
the
readings
usually
include
at
least
two
books
such
as
stephen
carters
integrity
and
the
dalai
lamas
ethics
for
the
new
millennium
as
well
as
articles
from
the
journal
of
information
ethics
the
harvard
business
review
and
numerous
other
journals
in
the
library
and
information
field
and
from
other
disciplines
models
for
ethical
decisionmaking
context
several
readings
and
references
to
websites
including
icies
website
have
been
included
throughout
the
course
to
provide
the
context
for
ethical
reflection
and
decisionmaking
in
particular
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
different
perspectives
from
cultural
social
and
individual
viewpoints
this
broader
understanding
is
essential
to
any
course
especially
this
course
the
course
is
taught
in
english
to
englishspeaking
students
and
is
thus
limited
in
the
readings
that
are
used
although
students
are
encouraged
to
bring
in
examples
from
their
own
readings
in
different
languages
and
from
experience
in
their
own
countries
and
cultures
i
have
consistently
emphasized
my
own
limitations
and
encouraged
others
to
broaden
the
views
of
everyone
in
the
course
one
very
helpful
if
complex
source
for
understanding
context
is
clare
beghtols
work
on
ethical
warrant
dr
beghtol
who
is
on
the
faculty
of
the
university
of
toronto
faculty
of
information
studies
draws
upon
her
extensive
research
to
address
problems
of
creating
ethically
based
globally
accessible
and
culturally
acceptable
knowledge
representation
and
organization
systems
and
foundation
principles
for
the
ethical
treatment
of
different
cultures
basing
her
work
on
the
u
n
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
she
presents
the
concept
of
cultural
hospitality
to
act
as
a
theoretical
framework
for
the
ethical
warrant
of
knowledge
representation
and
organization
systems
she
concludes
that
the
concept
of
cultural
hospitality
is
promising
for
assessing
the
ethical
foundations
of
systems
for
representing
new
knowledge
and
organizations
systems
and
for
revising
existing
systems
reminding
us
that
each
individual
belongs
to
a
number
of
different
cultures
at
different
levels
e
g
living
in
one
country
speaking
different
languages
adhering
to
policies
and
practices
of
different
religions
andor
political
parties
belonging
to
different
social
organizations
etc
she
notes
that
individuals
may
and
do
legitimately
disagree
she
also
argues
that
the
boundaries
among
cultures
can
themselves
be
fuzzy
and
create
tensions
within
an
individual
in
her
discussions
of
the
relationships
of
any
particular
culture
to
its
information
needs
and
systems
and
noting
differences
among
oral
and
written
cultures
she
raises
questions
concerning
what
kinds
of
information
people
need
what
they
do
with
it
the
extent
to
which
they
value
it
and
whether
they
choose
to
perpetuate
the
information
her
thoughtful
if
somewhat
densely
packed
paper
raises
several
questions
such
as
whether
principles
of
cultural
hospitality
can
be
used
to
develop
cultureneutral
systems
and
theories
which
deserve
much
more
discussion
her
paper
continues
to
stimulate
thinking
and
discussion
by
students
models
and
frameworks
the
wheel
over
the
fifteen
years
of
teaching
the
course
we
have
used
a
series
of
models
to
assist
students
with
ethical
reflection
and
decisionmaking
initially
prof
almagno
used
the
model
of
a
wheel
with
four
groups
of
questions
in
the
center
hub
what
why
how
who
when
where
foreseeable
effects
and
viable
alternatives
the
spokes
of
the
wheel
are
creativeimagination
reasonanalysis
principles
affectivity
individual
experience
group
experience
authority
comedy
and
tragedy
the
questions
in
the
hub
provided
questions
for
gathering
information
and
to
help
in
revealing
other
questions
to
be
asked
to
determine
reality
they
also
provide
a
reminder
that
ethical
thinking
requires
dialogue
even
if
only
with
ones
self
the
spokes
serve
as
evaluation
resources
through
which
moral
consciousness
and
awareness
can
unfold
and
they
provide
a
systematic
process
to
address
the
concerns
about
how
to
evaluate
each
step
in
making
a
decision
while
some
students
found
the
wheel
helpful
in
assisting
their
decisionmaking
process
many
found
the
steps
suggested
by
the
spokes
to
be
somewhat
confusing
and
to
overlap
mason
et
al
checklist
one
example
used
is
that
proposed
by
mason
et
al
in
ethics
of
information
management
they
remind
the
readers
that
ethical
dialogues
are
dynamic
and
nonlinear
and
suggest
a
checklist
of
six
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account
when
resolving
an
ethical
issue
these
steps
are
what
are
the
facts
what
ethical
principles
standards
or
norms
should
be
applied
who
should
decide
who
should
benefit
from
the
decision
how
should
the
decision
be
made
what
steps
should
be
taken
to
prevent
this
issue
from
occurring
again
step
one
relates
to
morally
relevant
considerations
and
requires
both
determining
pertinent
information
understanding
the
life
cycles
involved
and
identification
of
key
decisionmaking
processes
and
identifying
all
the
key
stakeholders
their
values
motivation
and
physical
history
this
step
establishes
what
is
the
second
step
concentrates
on
what
ought
to
be
and
identifies
ethical
considerations
to
be
applied
the
third
step
seeks
to
identify
who
should
take
necessary
actions
how
to
ensure
that
all
stakeholders
are
included
and
legitimacy
and
right
to
make
decisions
as
well
as
the
ability
to
affect
a
resolution
step
four
addresses
the
various
benefits
of
all
the
stakeholders
and
how
to
balance
these
including
both
shortterm
and
longrun
considerations
step
five
addresses
the
method
of
decisionmaking
which
must
be
and
perceived
to
be
fair
and
ethical
the
final
step
recognizes
that
each
decision
becomes
a
precedent
and
seeks
to
decide
what
procedures
should
be
used
in
the
future
and
what
decision
will
be
best
for
the
future
of
course
this
process
must
be
used
within
the
specific
context
of
the
stakeholders
making
the
decision
and
within
the
wider
societal
context
this
framework
has
been
somewhat
useful
in
the
course
but
many
students
have
found
that
it
does
not
provide
sufficient
guidance
for
them
a
key
problem
is
that
is
starts
with
gathering
facts
before
reflecting
on
the
questions
related
to
fully
understanding
what
are
the
initial
questions
to
be
asked
to
help
identify
exactly
what
problems
and
issues
need
to
be
addressed
also
little
guidance
is
provided
to
address
other
questions
especially
the
second
one
woodward
framework
the
late
diana
woodward
formerly
on
the
faculty
of
drexel
university
presents
a
framework
for
deciding
issues
in
ethics
she
discusses
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
consequentiality
and
deontology
as
bases
for
ethical
reasoning
in
general
and
intellectual
freedom
in
general
concluding
that
a
deontological
defense
of
intellectual
freedom
is
safer
than
one
on
consequential
grounds
the
article
while
helpful
for
introducing
some
of
the
philosophical
foundations
and
theoretical
bases
for
ethical
reasoning
does
not
provide
a
useful
framework
for
addressing
many
practical
realworld
issues
oboyle
oboyle
concentrates
on
the
use
of
the
code
of
ethics
from
the
association
for
computing
machinery
acm
described
as
deontological
because
of
its
enumeration
of
rights
what
is
owed
by
others
and
duties
what
is
owed
to
others
within
a
general
ethical
decisionmaking
process
to
determine
an
action
providing
a
sound
discussion
of
earlier
writings
on
the
acm
code
he
places
the
code
within
a
general
ethical
decisionmaking
process
he
differentiates
between
to
human
faculties
intellect
and
will
oboyle
builds
on
work
of
rest
and
kohlberg
and
identifies
a
sixstage
process
moral
perception
and
personal
knowledge
of
the
moral
good
recognition
that
the
problem
exists
moral
discernment
and
personal
ability
to
think
logically
stating
the
problem
clearly
moral
resolution
and
personal
ability
to
think
analytically
tackling
the
complexities
of
the
problem
to
arrive
at
an
individual
position
moral
assessment
and
personal
ability
to
assess
ones
freedom
assessment
including
being
aware
of
the
doubleedged
sword
of
new
technologies
moral
decision
and
personal
knowledge
of
ones
duties
decision
including
personal
duty
and
obligations
and
moral
action
and
personal
willingness
to
follow
ones
intellect
free
will
used
to
take
action
oboyle
finds
that
the
acm
code
is
helpful
with
the
first
three
stages
but
not
with
the
other
three
and
that
training
is
needed
to
apply
the
code
effectively
he
raises
two
provocative
suggestions
that
implementing
the
code
could
be
advanced
by
making
an
individual
ethical
audit
part
of
an
employees
performance
review
and
by
hiring
people
who
have
some
understanding
and
training
in
ethical
behavior
the
students
have
found
it
helpful
in
applying
codes
of
ethics
to
actual
situations
and
problems
and
they
find
the
questions
to
be
provocative
because
the
article
concentrates
specifically
on
the
acm
code
the
sixstage
framework
also
has
limitations
also
it
does
not
include
extensive
discussion
of
the
various
needs
and
perspectives
of
the
various
stakeholders
nor
does
it
address
many
of
the
complex
cultural
issues
ottoson
one
example
from
the
corporate
sector
was
gerald
ottoson
a
retired
industry
executive
who
is
now
a
consultant
ottoson
has
conducted
numerous
ethics
seminars
over
the
years
for
workers
in
corporations
his
approach
is
to
spend
a
small
amount
of
time
on
fundamental
ethical
values
e
g
honesty
mercy
justice
etc
and
to
concentrate
on
models
to
examine
real
cases
a
suggested
pattern
of
inquiry
is
presented
as
a
checklist
in
reviewing
and
evaluating
past
actions
the
model
uses
a
series
of
questions
who
should
make
the
decision
includes
where
the
legitimate
power
to
make
the
decision
lies
limits
on

etc
and
how
should
the
decision
be
reached
inclusion
in
the
process
perception
of

avoidance
of
paternalism
he
notes
that
decisionmaking
is
always
a
compromise
there
is
no
perfect
solution
and
that
there
will
always
be
some
regrettable
aspects
of
the
ultimate
decision
he
also
realistically
argues
that
the
final
decisions
often
leave
the
decision
maker
feeling
a
bit
uncomfortable
while
his
framework
is
incomplete
and
open
to
many
different
interpretations
the
students
find
this
example
used
in
conjunction
with
others
to
be
helpful
because
of
its
emphasis
on
the
workplace
and
its
realistic
questions
dr
christine
altenburger
a
retired
faculty
member
from
the
university
of
pittsburgh
graduate
school
of
public
and
international
affairs
taught
applied
ethics
for
many
years
in
her
teaching
she
developed
a
series
of
principles
and
a
framework
unpublished
which
she
has
given
permission
to
use
in
our
classes
the
basic
principles
she
identifies
summarized
from
those
frequently
found
in
the
literature
are
do
no
harm
do
good
if
possible
observe
the
cannons
of
justice
be
fair
respect
the
rights
dignity
and
freedom
of
all
individuals
she
also
presents
a
flow
diagram
beginning
with
gathering
facts
leading
to
analysis
and
judgment
and
incorporating
decision
loops
to
reconsider
answers
to
questions
these
and
numerous
readings
have
been
used
throughout
our
course
but
none
provided
the
kind
of
framework
or
guide
needed
for
our
students
as
they
worked
towards
resolutions
of
their
problems
one
very
helpful
resource
i
have
used
is
the
thinkers
guide
to
understanding
the
foundations
of
ethical
reasoning
critical
thinking
concept
and
tools
by
richard
paul
and
linda
elder
this
brief
guide
provides
a
concise
discussion
of
the
importance
of
critical
thinking
and
the
elements
of
thought
a
checklist
for
reasoning
and
a
series
of
questions
using
these
elements
it
also
summarizes
problems
of
egocentric
thinking
and
introduces
a
concise
and
straightforward
introduction
to
the
function
of
ethics
expanding
on
the
discussion
of
egocentric
thought
and
addressing
problems
of
pseudoethics
it
discusses
the
differences
between
ethics
and
religion
social
conventions
sexual
taboos
political
ideology
and
the
law
the
authors
also
remind
the
readers
of
why
it
is
important
to
distinguish
among
questions
of
ethics
social
conventions
religion
and
law
and
they
present
a
series
of
elements
of
ethical
reasoning
they
propose
an
eightstep
process
to
determine
the
logic
of
an
ethical
question
purpose
considering
an
individuals
rights
and
needs
as
well
as
those
of
others
key
ethical
questions
information
needed
to
answer
the
questions
concepts
and
principles
to
guide
thinking
main
assumptions
used
points
of
view
of
all
stakeholders
main
inferencesconclusions
what
are
the
alternatives
are
all
being
considered
etc
and
implications
for
self
and
others
including
consequences
questions
of
harmgood
etc
this
framework
has
worked
successfully
for
students
to
address
a
wide
range
of
questions
and
problems
i
have
also
used
it
effectively
as
part
of
a
brief
introduction
to
information
ethics
is
our
required
introductory
course
for
library
and
information
science
students
understanding
information
in
other
classes
and
in
continuing
education
workshop
in
the
introductory
course
students
worked
in
groups
of
six
to
discuss
the
process
they
would
use
walking
through
the
eight
steps
to
respond
to
one
of
several
hypothetical
examples
based
on
a
realworld
case
in
each
case
the
students
indicated
that
the
framework
encourages
them
to
ask
many
questions
and
to
examine
different
perspectives
and
issues
they
also
noted
the
usefulness
of
the
framework
in
working
through
individual
problems
a
significant
flaw
in
the
framework
is
that
it
focuses
on
logic
and
does
not
recognize
the
individuals
emotions
and
subjective
feelings
this
leads
to
a
discussion
of
the
importance
of
recognizing
that
no
human
is
ever
totally
objective
and
of
learning
ones
own
biases
personal
values
and
cultural
perspectives
the
guide
seems
to
be
the
best
tool
in
our
courses
to
help
students
work
through
ethical
reflection
towards
making
moral
decisions
because
it
focuses
on
steps
in
critical
thinking
and
encourages
students
to
work
through
the
steps
looping
back
to
earlier
steps
in
the
process
the
steps
rely
on
logic
and
objectivity
and
do
not
take
into
account
the
fact
that
no
human
is
ever
completely
objective
this
shortcoming
can
of
course
be
addressed
by
the
teacher
through
readings
and
by
raising
questions
in
the
discussion
the
guide
also
serves
to
help
stimulate
discussion
among
students
and
encourage
raising
questions
about
the
many
options
to
be
considered
throughout
the
steps
proposed
undergraduate
course
at
this
point
the
undergraduate
course
is
in
the
earliest
planning
stages
several
challenges
must
be
addressed
teaching
undergraduates
rather
than
graduate
students
making
the
course
both
attractive
and
relevant
for
undergraduates
and
incorporating
appropriate
technologies
although
i
have
had
the
occasional
undergraduate
in
my
classes
usually
from
our
bsis
program
or
the
honors
college
with
one
student
from
the
school
of
engineering
i
have
not
taught
undergraduates
while
i
have
done
some
research
about
differences
in
expectations
learning
styles
and
experiences
in
the
social
web
i
must
admit
to
some
trepidation
recognizing
that
an
increasing
number
of
students
in
my
introductory
courses
enter
directly
from
college
and
knowing
that
students
in
this
upperlevel
course
will
be
predominantly
college
seniors
reduces
this
concern
to
a
great
extent
building
on
the
extensive
use
of
case
studies
and
online
discussions
and
group
interaction
in
my
courses
i
enrolled
in
a
daylong
workshop
in
casebased
learning
this
workshop
was
extremely
helpful
and
helped
me
determine
that
this
was
the
approach
to
use
i
have
decided
to
use
cases
based
on
three
primary
areas
intellectual
property
protection
and
use
particularly
downloading
of
music
and
videos
freedom
of
expression
e
g
restrictions
on
hate
speech
at
universities
content
on
facebook
myspace
etc
and
gaming
i
am
currently
examining
the
growing
literature
on
these
three
areas
especially
existing
case
studies
to
determine
which
readings
and
examples
to
include
i
plan
to
use
fiction
and
nonfiction
if
possible
getting
the
assistance
of
an
undergraduate
to
help
identify
pertinent
literature
simulation
models
related
specifically
to
information
ethics
are
starting
to
appear
in
the
research
literature
at
the
alise
conference
i
learned
of
one
being
developed
by
ken
fleischmann
at
the
university
of
maryland
and
his
colleagues
and
we
have
agreed
that
we
will
collaborate
he
will
make
available
the
beta
version
when
it
becomes
available
from
his
research
project
which
will
probably
not
be
for
at
least
two
years
and
i
will
provide
ideas
on
content
and
presentation
in
addition
as
part
of
a
proposal
i
am
developing
with
colleagues
in
information
science
and
telecommunications
we
will
identify
ways
our
two
projects
if
ours
is
funded
can
share
information
and
learn
from
each
others
even
if
our
proposal
is
not
selected
to
go
forward
as
the
single
proposal
from
the
university
or
if
it
is
not
funded
i
plan
to
work
with
these
colleagues
to
develop
and
incorporate
simulations
into
the
course
this
work
is
in
the
earliest
stages
and
i
would
appreciate
comments
and
suggestions
for
the
proposed
course
to
help
make
it
as
good
as
it
can

that
is
one
of
the
core

informatics
curriculum
ethics

explores
the
ethical
dilemmas
that
exist
where
human
beings
information

the
course
tests
the
notion
that
the
most
effective
way
to
explore
how
new
technologies
relate
to
integrity
truthfulness
trust
respect
for
privacy
and
individuality
is
to
become
immersed
in
a
technological
environment
where
unethical
behavior
as
well
as
ethical
norms
can
be
safely
and
confidentially
tested
evaluated
observed
and
experienced
the
paper
will
summarize
an
emerging
literature
in
three
areas
the
theories
of
ethics
and
information
technology
the
characteristics
of
the
net
generation
regarding
the

in
assessing
the
ethical
implications
of
new

introduction
a
new
course
ethics
and
information
technology
is
a
significant
contribution
by
the
university
of
michigans
school
of
information
to
a
new
undergraduate
concentration
in
informatics
the
course
is
one
of
four
required
core
courses
for
the
newly
approved
major
which
itself
represents
a
deep
collaboration
among
faculty
across
three
university
schools
the
uniqueness
of
the
undertaking
raises
the
stakes
challenging
the
faculty
of
each
school
to
define
a
rich
field
of
study
in
ways
that
resonates
intellectually
across
the
entire
partnership
the
nature
of
this
crosscampus
collaboration
influences
the
design
of
new
courses
as
well
as
the
approaches
to
undergraduate
education
ethics
and
information
technology
tests
the
notion
that
the
most
effective
way
to
explore
how
emerging
technologies
relate
to
information
ethics
is
to
immerse
students
in
a
technological
environment
where
unethical
behavior
as
well
as
ethical
norms
can
be
safely
and
confidentially
tested
evaluated
observed
and
experienced
in
this
regard
the
course
exists
at
the
intersection
of
technology
ethics
and
pedagogy
this
paper
frames
the
principal
theoretical
issues
that
underlie
the
design
of
the
course
and
outlines
its
most
salient
pedagogical
features
context
ethics
is
variously
defined
o
e
d
as
a
branch
of
philosophy
concerned
with
evaluating
human
action
the
study
of
individual
or
group
values
or
a
system
of
defining
right
and
wrong
behaviors
when
applied
to
the
professions
ethics
defines
a
code
of
standards
governing
fair
and
responsible
conduct
with
other
members
of
a
profession
and
the
general
public
in
association
with
computer
and
information
technologies
ethics
concerns
the
relationship
of
systems
with
the
people
who
use
them
most
recently
the
concept
of
information
ethics
has
extended
philosophical
consideration
well
beyond
the
human
behavior
to
explore
the
ethical
properties
of
information
objects
the
study
of
ethics
within
the
context
of
information
technology
is
international
in
scope
the
international
center
for
information
ethics
icie
identifies
individuals
in
over
organizations
around
the
world
whose
primary
field
of
scholarship
and
teaching
is
information

the
field

icies
selective

in
universities
with
a
primary
focus
on
information
ethics
research
nearly
a
dozen
scholarly
journals
continuing
sequences
of
international
conferences
and
highly
touted
monographs
and
compendiums
attest
to
the
deepening
scholarly
interest
in
ethics
and
emerging
technologies
the
teaching
of
ethics
has
traditionally
been
an
important
element
of
the
university
curriculum
the
university
of
michigans
ethics
in
public
life
initiative
for
example
has
compiled
a
current
list
of
over
regularlyscheduled
courses
that
involve
ethics
as
a
substantial
component
academic
disciplines
offering
these
courses
range
from
the
traditional
and
obvious
e
g
philosophy
to
the
more
subtle
and
nuanced
e
g
environmental
studies
every
professional
school
at
michigan
offers
at
least
one
course
at
the
graduate
level
focused
on
either
professional
ethics
or
ethics
policies
appropriate
to
the
profession
those
professional
schools
that
offer
undergraduate
courses
or
degrees
include
but
do
not
necessarily
require
the
study
of
ethical
issues
to
complete
a
major
ethics
in
the
ischools
however
presents
a
paradox
ethics
is
simultaneously
a
core
principle
governing
the
formulation
of
their
teaching
missions
and
a
minor
or
peripheral
area
of
research
on
the
one
hand
the
websites
for
all
of
the
ischools
describe
ethics
as
one
of
their
important
areas
of
concern
nearly
all
ischools
offer
specific
graduatelevel
courses
that
include
an
investigation
of
either
professional
ethics
or
ethics
policy
issues
and
yet
six
of
the
members
of
the
consortium
of
ischools
account
for
a
total
of
only
eight
faculty
in
the
icie
database
of
research
specialists
in
information
ethics
although
the
icie
database
does
not
reflect
the
efforts
of
faculty
who
primarily
or
exclusively
teach
ethics
it
is
clear
that
research
on
ethics
is
not
at
this
point
in
time
a
central
research
or
teaching
strength
of
most
ischools
a
framework
the
undergraduate
course
ethics
and
information
technology
exists
at
the
intersection
of
three
distinctive
concepts
the
philosophy
of
ethics
the
social
characteristics
of
emerging
information
technologies
and
the
learning
styles
of
a
particular
cohort
of
students
although
literature
on
the
theoretical
foundation
for
each
of
these
areas
is
vast
there
is
a
particular
the
mcrobb
framework
and
its
supporting
literature
is
oriented
toward
the
ethical
issues
involved
in
distance
learning
drawing
for
support
on
the
literature
of
computer
supported
collaborative
learning
the
conceptual
model
represented
by
the
mcrobb
illustration
however
provides
a
convenient
mechanism
for
highlighting
how
the
issues
that
are
at
the
heart
of
the
michigan
course
overlap
and
intersect
the
framework
includes
three
pressures
that
constrain
the
content
of
the
three
issue
areas
among
them
the
expectations
of
a
wider
audience
regarding
the
evolving
role
of
ethics
education
in
the
academy
the
limitations
imposed
by
university
technology
systems
and
perspectives
of
various
professional
bodies
or
academic
disciplines
on
the
appropriate
approaches
to
ethics
education
each
of
these
constraining
issues
is
at
work
in
the
design
of
a
course
that
purports
to
exist
outside
the
boundaries
of
the
existing
curriculum
ethics
and
information
technology
is
not
only
a
new
course
but
one
that
straddles
and
attempts
to
incorporate
the
perspectives
of
the
three
disciplines
that
are
contributing
to
the
new
informatics
curriculum
the
framework
is
most
relevant
in
identifying
three
distinctive
intellectual
spaces
where
conceptual
overlap
creates
interesting
new
perspectives
first
the
boundary
where
the
study
of
ethics
and
the
characteristics
of
emerging
technology
overlap
labeled
in
the
figure
as
computer
ethics
provides
a
set
of
useful
ethical
models
that
are
the
intellectual
structure
of
course
second
the
boundary
where
ethics
and
pedagogy
overlap
orients
the
courses
interactive
design
and
the
flow
of
the
individual
course
modules
third
the
boundary
where
technology
and
pedagogy
overlap
provides
the
rationale
for
an
immersive
technology
environment
in
which
students
and
instructor
model
the
challenges
posed
by
a
suite
of
technologies
ethics
and
technology
scholarship
on
the
relationships
between
information
technology
and
ethical
beliefs
and
behaviors
have
been
debated
and
refined
for
the
past
fifty
years
how
this
scholarship
informs
the
teaching
of
these
relationships
is
less
well
understood
figure
the
links
between
technology
pedagogy
and
ethics
absence
of
literature
that
addresses
the
theoretical
foundations

the
intersection
mcrobb
jefferies
and
stahl
propose
a
framework
that
describes
research
findings
in
the
areas
where
the
concepts
overlap
and
establishes

is
to
flourish

and
to
do
so
through

of
information

james
moor
is
a
bridge
from
the
discipline
of
computer
ethics
to
the
broader
world
of
information
ethics
moor
initially
defined
computer
ethics
in
terms
of
a
policy
vacuum
that
occurs
when
new
technological
capabilities
provide
new
choices
for
action
in
an
environment
where
existing
policies
seem
inadequate
computer
ethics
includes
consideration
of
both
personal
and
social
policies
for
the
ethical
use
of
computer
technology
writing
twenty
years
later
following
the
explosion
of
the
world
wide
web
and
the
emergence
of
widespread
social
computing
applications
moor
called
for
a
more
flexible
and
agile
approach
to
investigating
the
relationship
of
new
technologies
to
human
ethical
behavior
moor
establishes
a
three
part
progressive
model
of
technology
development
that
relates
the
maturity
of
revolutionary
technology
to
increasing
ethical
complexity
according
to
his
model
more
people
will
be
involved
more
technology
will
be
used
and
hence
more
policy
vacuums
and
conceptual
muddles
will
arise
as
the
revolution
advances
in
the
case
of
emergent
immature
or
experimental
technologies
such
as
the
socially
oriented
tools
and
systems
typified
by
the
overused
moniker
web
moor
postulates
his
own
law
which
states
that
as
technological
revolutions
increase
their
social
impact
ethical
problems
increase
because
revolutionary
technology
provides
many
new
opportunities
for
action
for
which
well
thought
out
ethical
policies
will
not
have
been
developed
moor
lays
out
three
approaches
to
study
new
technologies
from
an
ethical
perspective
including
investigating
new
technologies
before
they
have
stabilized
using
multidisciplinary
approaches
to
research
and
adopting
sophisticated
ethical
analyses
to
avoid
the
tendency
to
revert
to
simplistic
costbenefit
analyses
that
translate
ethical
choices
into
monetary
terms
we
need
to
learn
about
the
technology
as
it
is
developing
and
to
project
and
assess
possible
consequences
of
its
various
applications
the
michigan
course
places
students
into
a
policyweak
environment
populated
by
technologies
whose
use
and
abuse
are
not
fully
understood
an
important
open
question
at
the
intersection
of
ethics
and
technology
is
whether
the
social
dynamics
of
new
technologies
are
generating
new
ethical
models
of
behavior
in
addressing
this
question
himma
focuses
on
the
role
of
ethics
in
informed
decision
making
he
reviews
and
ultimately
dismisses
claims
that
computer
ethics
has
a
claim
to
theoretical
uniqueness
understanding
computing
technologies
will
help
to
produce
wellinformed
ethical
views
regardless
of
how
we
characterize
those
technologies
rafael
capurro
adds
another
dimension
by
highlighting
the
nature
of
the
content
that
is
embedded
in
or
made
accessible
by
networked
technologies
he
argues
for
a
holistic
view
of
information
that
is
attentive
to
the
mass
transformationtransition
of
content
from
analog
to
digital
in
this
broader
sense
information
ethics
deals
with
questions
of
digitalization
i
e
the
reconstruction
of
all
possible
phenomena
in
the
world
as
digital
information
and
the
problems
caused
by
their
exchange
combination
and
utilization
capurro
makes
an
essential
connection
between
communication
technologies
and
the
human
propensity
to
share
and
preserve
a
basic
moral
principle
of
the
information
environment
he
claims
is
to
share
knowledge
or
the
right
to
communicate
in
a
digital
environment
which
includes
the
right
to
preserve
what
we
communicate
for
future
generations
capurro
reminds
us
that
the
appropriation
of
modern
information
technology
is
not
just
a
technical
also
but
a
culturallybounded
endeavor
luciano
floridi
presents
perhaps
the
most
well
developed
philosophical
perspective
on
the
ethical
issues
associated
with
information
and
communication
technologies
floridis
infosphere
encompasses
not
only
cyberspace
but
also
offline
and
analog
information
spaces
adopting
an
objectoriented
approach
to
the
design
of
a
new
ethical
model
floridi
defines
moral
action
as
a
dynamic
system
arising
out
of
the
interaction
of
seven
principal
components
the
agent
the
patient
their
interactions
the
agents
general
frame
of
information
the
factual
information
concerning
the
situation
that
is
at
least
partly
available
to
the
agent
the
general
environment
in
which
the
agent
and
patient
are
located
and
the
specific
situation
in
which
the
interaction
occurs
drawing
deeply
on
environmental
physics
floridi
restates
that
the
fundamental
principles
or
rules
of
this
dynamic
system
are
grounded
in
the
notion
of
information
entropy
that
is
the
destruction
pollution
and
depletion
of
information
objects
ought
not
to
be
caused
ought
to
be
prevented
ought
to
be
removed

as
a
parallel
floridis
model
and
the
norms
it
proposes
structure
the
flow
of
the
michigan
course
the
real
question
for
the
intersection
of
ethics
and
technology
is
the
extent
to
which
new
technologies
and
the
ways
that
people
use
them
foster
new
rules
of
ethical
behavior
perhaps
culturally
determined
or
whether
long
standing
principles
are
transferred
to
new
technological
contexts
the
pedagogical
focus
of
the
course
is
designed
in
part
to
explore
this
issue
dynamically
and
interactively
net
generation
pedagogy
a
course
that
examines
ethical
issues
associated
with
new
technologies
must
necessarily
take
account
of
the
learning
styles
and
the
general
attitudes
of
the
undergraduates
who
enroll
the
conceptual
design
of
the
course
as
well
as
its
intellectual
flow
of
the
individual
modules
and
use
of
technology
tools
in
and
outside
the
classroom
are
in
part
predicated
on
the
notion
that
todays
generation
of
undergraduates
is
somehow
different
than
previous
generations
allowing
for
fluidity
in
the
boundary
lines
a
case
can
be
made
that
at
any
point
in
time
generational
cohorts
bound
by
shared
experiences
and
history
exhibit
behavioral
and
attitudinal
cohesion
commentators
have
labeled
the
generation
of
students
born
since
a
somewhat
arbitrary
point
in
time
as
the
net
generation
in
part
because
they
have
grown
up
with
the
widespread
availability
of
personal
computers
and
the
internet
strauss
and
howe
characterize
the
members
of
the
net
generation
as
sheltered
and
protected
but
pressured
to
excel
endowed
with
a
strong
sense
of
their
own
specialness
indicated
by
high
selfesteem
confident
and
optimistic
they
may
be
more
team
oriented
than
previous
generations
more
comfortable
than
average
with
multitasking
and
very
literate
in
the
realm
of
digital
and
visual
technologies
gibbons
argues
that
the
affinity
of
todays
undergraduates
for
information
technology
translates
into
new
and
different
expectation
about
how
to
gather
work
with
translate
and
share
information
the
apparent
naturalness
with
which
undergraduates
embrace
new
technologies
leads
some
commentators
to
see
technological
determinism
at
work
lippincott
argues
that
digital
natives
have
acquired
styles
of
learning
and
modes
of
interpersonal
interaction
as
a
direct
result
of
the
availability
of
network
technologies
suggesting
that
the
implications
of
this
fact
extend
beyond
the
classroom
to
challenge
and
change
the
mission
and
purposes
of
libraries
and
other
information
services
nye
and
most
scholars
of
the
history
of
science
and
technology
reject
the
deterministic
thesis
arguing
instead
that
people
become
enmeshed
in
a
web
of
technical
choices
made
for
them
by
their
ancestors
helping
to
explain
why
people
may
seem
trapped
by
the
choices
others
have
made
the
design
of
the
michigan
course
rejects
a
deterministic
view
of
the
technologies
it
utilizes
but
starts
with
the
premise
that
there
are
generational
differences
in
the
perspectives
of
students
and
teachers
such
differences
may
be
manifested
genuinely
in
varying
comfort
levels
with
new
and
emerging
technologies
but
the
courses
structure
flow
and
assessment
methodologies
leave
open
the
question
of
whether
net
generation
learners
harbor
a
distinctive
ethical
world
view
in
the
use
of
these
technologies
the
centrality
of
trust
the
mcrobb

framework
figure
places
a
question
mark
at
the
center
of
its
analytical
framework
where
ethics
technology
and
pedagogy
meet
in
their
review
of
the
associated
research
literature
the
authors
found
that
there
seems
to
be
little
interest
in
the
exploration
of
the
intersection
of
those
areaswhat
appears
to
be
lacking
is
a
good
overview
of
the
relationships
of
the
different
issues
involved
in
adapting
the
mcrobb
framework
course
designers
used
the
concept
of
trust
as
an
organizing
principle
for
the
individual
modules
the
o
e
d
defines
trust
as
confidence
in
or
reliance
on
some
quality
or
attribute
of
a
person
or
thing
or
the
truth
of
a
statement
in
placing
trust
at
the
intersection
of
ethics
information
technology
and
pedagogy
the
michigan
course
opens
students
to
an
examination
of
trust
from
multiple
perspectives
for
example
trust
in
individual
identity
trust
of
the
integrity
of
digital
content
trust
in
the
transparency
of
open
source
code
and
the
community
of
people
who
create
it
as
the
case
studies
in
hutchings
demonstrate
the
notion
of
trust
also
enters
into
the
dynamic
engagements
between
teacher
and
student
as
well
as
student
to
student
interactions
inside
and
outside
of
class
in
terms
of
identity
with
the
context
of
the
course
buchanan
and
ess
demonstrate
that
trust
bears
on
the
extent
to
which
behavior
within
a
virtual
environment
is
conditioned
by
knowledge
of
the
identity
of
the
agents
within
the
environment
the
creation
modification
and
behaviors
of
avatars
in
an
online
environment
is
a
particularly
apt
example
of
identity
trust
chesney
follows
the
same
line
of
reasoning
in
examining
the
trust
metrics
underlying
such
collaborative
writing
efforts
as
wikipedia
in
terms
of
content
trust
is
intimately
related
to
the
notion
of
integrity
which
duranti
defines
universally
for
textual
documents
in
terms
of
reliability
and
authenticity
it
is
generally
accepted
by
all
literate
civilizations
that
documents
are
trustworthy
that
is
reliable
because
of
their
completeness
and
controlled
procedure
of
creation
and
which
are
guaranteed
to
be
intact
and
what
they
purport
to
be
that
is
authentic
by
controlled
procedures
of
transmission
and
preservation
can
be
presumed
to
be
truthful
that
is
genuine
as
to
their
content
mitchell
reaches
a
less
technical
but
no
less
measurable
conclusion
in
reference
to
trust
in
visual
content
if
an
image
follows
the
conventions
of
photography
and
seems
internally
coherent
if
the
visual
evidence
that
it
presents
support
the
caption
and
if
we
can
confirm
that
this
visual
evidence
is
consistent
with
other
things
that
we
accept
as
knowledge
within
the
framework
of
the
relevant
discourse
then
we
feel
justified
in
the
attitude
that
seeing
is

by
a
team
of
two
faculty
one
from

and
one
from
the
school

and
information

explores
the
ethical
dilemmas
that
exist
where
human
beings
information

systems
interact
modular
in

the
course
introduces
students
to
a
variety
of
ethical
models
from
historical
and
crosscultural
perspectives
and
then
explores
the
relevance
of
these
models
to
a
variety
of
new
and
emerging
technologies
that
are
inherently
social
in
their
construction
and
use
initial
examples
of
issues
that
the
course
covers
in
discrete
modules
include
interpersonal

systems
experiment
with
individual

and
examine
the
mechanics
of

two
major
instructional
objectives

technical
experiences
in

to
enhance
understanding
of
ethical
challenges
presented
by

apply
ethics
theories
to
interpret

when
using
a
variety
of
information
technology
tools
and
evaluate
the
nature
of
ethical
choices
made
by
self
and
others
when
serving
various
roles
new
information
technologies
raise
knotty
issues
regarding
integrity
truthfulness
trust
respect
for

as
well
as
the
variations
in
ethical
behavior
across
gender
racial
and
ethnic
group
socioeconomic
class
sexual
orientation
and
global
cultures
the
course
tests
the
notion
that
the
most
effective
way
to
explore
these
issues
is
to
become
immersed
in
a
technological
environment
where
unethical
behavior
as
well
as
ethical
norms
can
be
safely
and
confidentially
tested
evaluated
observed
and
experienced
the
course
will
mix
experiential
learning
with
individual
and
group
interaction
with
a
variety
of
technologies
this
course
is
unique
in
its
construction
and
in
its
mix
of
technological
tools
for
instruction
although
a
vibrant
literature
is
emerging
on
approaches
to
teaching
ethics
and
information
technology
and
on
the
use
of
technology
in
the
classroom
relatively
little
is
known
about
learning
processes
and
learning
outcomes
in
the
combination
of
ethics
and
emerging
social
technologies
the
course
will
in
part
form
a
test
environment
for
learning
about
how
to
use
innovative
technological
tools
to
teach
about
the
ethical
dilemmas
posed
by
these
same
technologies
significant
instruction
takes
place
with
the
aid
of

scheme
conclusion
the
design
and
implementation
of
an
innovative
course
on
ethics
and
information
technology
is
a
somewhat
risky
undertaking
first
we
do
not
yet
know
of
the
market
for
the
concentration
and
the
extent
to
which
the
new
course
will
both
attract
students
to
the
concentration
and
fulfill
critical
learning
objectives
for
the
new
informatics
program
second
we
cannot
anticipate
the
extent
to
which
experiential
teaching
in
the
domain
of
ethics
and
information
technology
will
lead
to
specific
learning
outcomes
toward
this
end
the
course
instructors
have
partnered
with
the
universitys
center
for
research
on
learning
and
teaching
to
develop
assessment
metrics
new
student
feedback
mechanisms
third
we
are
not
sure
that
the
course
will
or
should
result
in
behavioral
changes
in
the
students
who
complete
the
course
we
believe
the
risk
of
failure
measured
by
either
low
enrollment
or
low
student
evaluations
is
offset
by
the
opportunity
to
create
a
learning
environment
that
serves
as
a
model
laboratory
for
new
research
on
teaching
ethics
at
the
undergraduate

abstract
this
paper
examines
social
justice
as
a
praxis
oriented
approach
for
infusing
ethics
and
multiculturalism
in
undergraduate
informatics
education
social
justice
education
includes
an
interdisciplinary
study
of
information
and
communication
technologies
ict
that
analyzes
unequal
power
relations
that
exist
in
society
and
a
set
of
interactive
experiential
pedagogical
principles
that
help
students
understand
the
meaning
of
social
difference
in
their
personal
lives
in
their
professional
lives
and
in
their
civic
lives
the
paper
summarizes
the
theoretical
basis
of
social
justice
and
its
relationship
to
ethics
multiculturalism
and
ict
the

also
presents
a
pedagogical
approach

that
are

by
humans
to
create
organize
transfer
and
utilize
that
information
in
a

are
collectively
known
as
the

this

the
ways
in
which
we
copyright

information
interact

and
function
on
the
job
and
in
our
daily
lives
emerging
technologies
also
raise
new
economic
cultural
legal
ethical
and
social
issues
that
are
of
grave
importance
to
society
the
college
of
information
sciences
and
technology
ist
at
the
pennsylvania
state
university
offers
an
existing
course
ist
the
information
environment
which
surveys
these
diverse
issues
this
course
examines
how
and
why
the
evolving
information
environment
influences
the
design
development
and
use
of
ict
this
course
also
examines
the
social
impacts
of
ict
on
people
organizations
and
societies
the
information
environment
is
a
messy
the
issues
are
not
clearly
identified
there
are
competing
interests
and
solutions
are
extremely
difficult
to
develop
because
there
is
no
one
best
answer
to
the
problem
to
assist
students
in
developing
the
skills
necessary
for
coping
with
this
situation
the
course
employs
a
social
justice
approach
to
education
the
subject
matter
of
the
course
is
learned
through
a
series
of
problems
that
enable
students
to
learn
about
the
layers
of
the
information
environment
and
the
factors
embedded
in
them
the
learning
format
emphasizes
a
studentcentered
classroom
activities
and
teambased
projects
that
feature
participation
inclusiveness
affirmation
of
human
agency
social
responsibility
and
collaborative
work
in
small

through
individual
and
group
learning
activities
students
and
the
educator
examine
the
influence
of
environmental
factors
on
ict
and
the
impact
of
ict
on
the
environment
this
paper
summarizes
the
primary
theoretical
and
pedagogical
features
of
this
course
and
the
broader
implications
of
social
justice
pedagogies
for
educators
theoretical
foundations
according
to
adams
bell
and
giffin
social
justice
education
seeks
the
full
and
equal
participation
of
all
groups
in
a
society
this
is
a
vision
of
society
in
which
diverse
social
groups
mutually
shaped
ict
to
meet
their
needs
in
such
a
society
individuals
are
both
selfdetermining
able
to
develop
their
full
capabilities
and
interdependent
capable
of
interacting
democratically
with
others
students
should
have
both
a
sense
of
social
responsibility
as
well
as
a
sense
of
their
own
agency
to
speak
and
act
in
a
manner
that
supports
their
beliefs
social
justice
education
is
also
praxis
oriented
praxis
posits
that
theory
and
practice
are
interwoven
with
practice
being
shaped
by
informal
and
formal
tacit
and
explicit
theories
hence
the
way
that
we
identify
and
articulate
problems
that
exist
in
the
information
environment
the
solutions
that
we
entertain
as
viable
and
the
methods
that
we
choose
as
appropriate
for
realizing
those
solutions
are
all
theoretical
as
well
as
practical
questions
consequently
theory
serves
three
important
functions
first
theory
enables
us
to
reflect
critically
upon
our
intentions
decisionmaking
and
the
means
we
use
to
actualize
our
choices
in
the
design
of
ict
computerized
information
systems
for
instance
are
generally
designed
for
some
idealized
audience
ethical
problems
surface
when
users
with
different
knowledge
requirements
attempt
to
use
the
system
hoesle
notes
that
computerized
information
system
use
requires
people
to
act
and
think
in
prescribed
ways
that
privilege
western
cultural
traditions
while
marginalizing
the
cultural
traditions
of
others
thirdworld
cultures
have
unique
forms
of
knowledge
embodied
in
cultural
artifacts
such
as
mythologies
storytelling
proverbs
art
and
dance
while
these
forms
of
knowledge
are
legitimate
and
deserve
to
be
preserved
hoesle
posits
that
they
cannot
be
equally
wellrepresented
through
computerized
ways
of
storing
representing
and
transmitting
knowledge
in
the
years
since
hoesle
authored
this
manuscript
ict
has
advanced
significantly
with
web
technologies
relatively
low
skilled
users
can
author
content
in
a
variety
of
social
media
formats
such
as
video
podcasts
wikis
and
blogs
with
these
diverse
formats
users
now
have
more
options
for
representing
their
unique
worldview
and
hoesles
concern
may
be
less
salient
the
challenge
may
be
less
a
problem
of
inadequacies
in
computerized
representations
of
knowledge
and
more
a
problem
of
providing
access
to
the
tools
and
competencies
that
make
self
authoring
possible
open
source
applications
provide
lower
cost
technology
solutions
to
organizations
and
individuals
seeking
alternatives
to
proprietary
information
systems
both
web
and
open
source
are
based
on
communityoriented
design
intentions
and
choices
and
expand
the
usage
options
for
nontraditional
users
of
ict
second
theory
has
the
potential
to
help
us
stay
conscious
of
our
position
as
historical
subjects
ethical
implications
arise
from
these
historically
situated
power
relations
for
instance
ict
is
often
seen
as
an
essential
component
of
development
and
democratic
practices
this
viewpoint
is
expressed
in
the
context
of
developing
countries
and
historically
underserved
groups
in
the
developed
world
these
groups
are
seen
as
excluded
from
the
information
society
and
consequently
should
apply
ict
or
risk
being
left
behind
this
line
of
reasoning
not
only
supports
the
technology
imperative
but
also
subscribes
to
a
development
ideology
that
is
based
on
a
concept
of
history
as
linear
and
universal
all
societies
and
people
go
through
the
same
stages
until
they
reach
the
same
economic
levels
as
countries
and
people
considered
developed
the
assumption
is
that
ict
is
neutral
and
nondiscriminatory
in
that
it
potentially
provides
equal
opportunities
to
everyone
equal
access
to
ict
ensures
equal
benefits
however
this
ignores
historical
power
relations
such
as
colonialism
racism
and
sexism
to
which
ict
is
inextricably
linked
the
perception
that
icts
are
necessary
for
development
also
ignores
that
technology
invents
its
own
needs
such
as
software
and
hardware
upgrades
and
training
as
well
as
problems
such
as
the
environmental
degradation
that
results
from
a
western
lifestyle
ecologically
it
is
impossible
for
the
whole
world
to
adopt
a
western
lifestyle
yet
a
western
lifestyle
is
offered
as
the
standard
for
development
third
and
perhaps
most
importantly
theory
provides
a
framework
for
interrogating
our
practices
and
creating
novel
approaches
to
addressing
issues
in
the
information
environment
many
of
these
issues
such
as
social
and
digital
exclusion
privacy
and
community
and
democracy
have
strong
ethical
and
multicultural
implications
for
instance
the
digital
divide
is
at
least
as
much
about
cultural
differences
as
it
may
be
about
disparities
in
income
and
infrastructure
because
the
internet
enables
users
to
focus
solely
on
receiving
information
from
and
communicating
with
likeminded
individuals
paterson
worries
that
the
internet
may
foster
fragmented
existences
that
exacerbate
existing
social
differences
based
on
ethnicity
gender
geography
age
and
race
the
central
implication
underlying
these
issues
of
ethics
and
multiculturalism
is
how
diverse
people
in
different
parts
of
the
world
experience
the
effects
of
the
computerization
for
some
the
challenge
is
to
continuously
innovate
and
create
new
technologies
others
grapple
to
keep
up
with
the
continuous
changes
enabled
by
ict
and
still
others
struggle
to
put
in
place
the
basic
infrastructure
that
may
allow
them
to
participate
in
the
global
knowledgebased
society
praxis
forces
us
to
examine
how
power
operates
through
normalizing
discourses
about
ict
and
power
relations
praxis
reminds
us
to
continually
ask
in
whose
interest
prevailing
systems
operate
the
question
of
who
is
served
by
ict
provides
a
useful
analytic
tool
for
exposing
hierarchical
relationships
as
well
as
the
hidden
advantages
and
penalties
embedded
in
technologies
that
are
purportedly
neutral
a
commitment
to
social
justice
requires
an
ethical
attitude
towards
inclusion
of
diverse
cultures
and
the
potential
of
ict
to
improve
the
capacity
of
human
agents
to
transform
their
world
course

industry
orientation
of
the
ist
curriculum
and
my
professional
experience
and
graduate
education
in
information
systems
at
an
american
business
school
the
initial
design
of
the
course
focused
primarily
on
professional
ethics
using
the
acm
and
ieee
codes
of
professional
ethics
as
a
basis
students
were
grouped
in
teams
and
presented
with
fictitious
scenarios
that
portrayed
ethical
dilemmas
that
they
may
face
in
their
careers
the
scenarios
included
breaches
in
the
confidentiality
of
information
programmers
and
analysts
obligation
to
act
in
a
socially
responsible
manner
use
of
company
computers
for

property
and
electronic
monitoring
of
workers
while
the
scenarios
generated
good
discussion
students
didnt
seem
to
internalize
the
material
a
second
approach
was
to
replace
the
fictitious
scenarios
with
realworld
cases
from
the
popular
press
student
teams
were
asked
to
evaluate
and
debate
the
behaviors
of
the
various
stakeholders
presented
in
the
cases
again
most
students
failed
to
personalize
the
ethical
issues
to
obtain
insights
as
to
how
i
could
improve
the
course
i
instituted
a
student
quality
team
in
our
college
student
quality
teams
assess
the
classroom
learning
environment
and
provide
educators
with
feedback
to
help
them
improve
course
design
the
student
quality
team
program
is
studentorganized
and
managed
team
leaders
are
trained
in
quality
principles
team
management
survey
design
and
diplomacy
they
also
receive
nominal
salaries
team
members
are
recruited
from
students
enrolled
in
the
course
and
they
receive
one
credit
of
independent
study
for
their
effort
students
noted
that
the
scenarios
seemed
abstract
and
removed
from
their
daily
lived
experiences
they
had
little
formal
experience
working
in
a
business
organization
consequently
they
had
yet
to
develop
a
strong
professional
identity
also
because
ethics
was
isolated
in
a
course
module
and
presented
solely
as
a
professional
concern
the
importance
of
ethical
considerations
was
minimized
while
considering
the
student
feedback
i
attended
the
multicultural
teaching
academy
at
the
schreyer
institute
for
teaching
excellence
at
the
pennsylvania
state
university
social
justice
was
presented
as
an
approach
for
infusing
multiculturalism
and
ethics
in
undergraduate
education
social
justice
also
fit
with
my
research
interests
in
ict
and
social
exclusion
and
personal
commitment
to
improving
the
recruitment
retention
and
academic
excellence
for
women
students
of
color
and
international
students
who
are
severely
underrepresented
in
our
program
hence
social
justice
formed
the
basis
for
the
third
iteration
pedagogical
approach
a
pedagogy
respectful
of
social
justice
and
human
diversity
begins
with
the
educators
sense
of
social
responsibility
education
is
fundamentally
ethical
and
political
in
nature
ethics
and
politics
are
inherent
in
the
teacherstudent
relationship
in
the
physical
conditions
of
the
classroom
in
the
grading
and
in
the
readings
and
course
content
that
are
chosen
or
excluded
from
the
syllabus
to
achieve
a
democratic
learning
environment
that
is
inclusive
and
meaningful
to
students
the
first
day
of
class
begins
with
the
educator
presenting
an
overview
of
the
course
and
the
key
learning
objectives
these
learning
objectives
include
identify
major
themes
in
information
policy
studies
e
g
ethics
privacy
workplace
monitoring
security
and
relate
these
themes
to
the
applications
of
icts
use
conceptual
frameworks
to
frame
analysis
of
icts
in
their
context
of
use
at
varying
levels
of
analysis
e
g
individual
organizational
societal
global
reflected
in
the
information
environment
analyze
the
impacts
of
information
systems
and
technology
and
make
appropriate
policy
recommendations
students
are
then
broken
into
teams
and
asked
to
identity
three
important
topics
that
they
would
like
to
explore
the
class
then
organizes
the
topics
into
themes
that
are
then
incorporated
into
the
syllabus
table
provides
an

that
were

learning
module
in
addition
to
inclusiveness
the
educator
seeks
to
leverage
the
cultural
diversity
that
exists
in
the
classroom
being
socialized
and
living
in
the
dominant
culture
often
lessens
our
awareness
that
our
beliefs
and
behaviors
reflect
a
particular
racial
ethnic
or
gender
affiliation
according
to
wlodkowski
and
ginsberg
white
males
have
a
more
difficult
time
acknowledging
the
idea
that
angloamericans
and
western
norms
enjoy
a
privileged
position
in
the
united
states
educational
system
culture
is
taught
and
understood
implicitly
which
is
why
it
is
difficult
to
explicitly
describe
who
we
are
culturally
consequently
we
are
more
likely
to
experience
uniqueness
of
our
own
culture
when
we
are
in
the
presence
of
those
who
are
different
from
ourselves
since
on
average
of
the
students
enrolled
in
the
course
are
white
males
the
challenge
is
to
exploit
the
cultural
diversity
that
exists
within
this
group
for
example
students
vary
in
their
political
affiliation
the
social
media
learning
activity
exploits
this
difference
by
asking
students
to
compare
and
contrast
the
use
of
you
tube
facebook
and
other
social
media
applications
by
presidential
candidates
to
help
students
understand
how
gender
mediates
social
interactions
male
students
create
female
avatars
and
interact
with
others
in
a
virtual
world
they
then
report
on
their
experiences
in
the
assignment
on
digital
divide
and
internet
indispensability
students
keep
journals
on
their
internet
use
for
a
hour
period
they
then
reflect
on
the
benefits
of
their
use
as
well
as
the
losses
they
may
have
suffered
if
they
lacked
internet
access
after
they
complete
this
assignment
i
ask
students
to
collect
statistics
about
ict
diffusion
and
other
ereadiness
indicators
for
a
developing
country
of
their
choice
and
compare
these
to
comparable
indicators
for
the
us
students
are
often
astounded
by
the
disparities
that
they
uncover
and
in
some
cases
express
a
deeper
appreciation
for
the
privileges
that
they
derive
from
internet
access
a
few
students
are
highly
motivated
by
this
exercise
and
extend
this
work
for
their
semester
long
research
project
these
students
conduct
an
experiment
in
which
they
give
up
their
cell
phones
on
for
a
weekend
and
reflect
on
this
experience
as
a
means
of
experiencing
life
as
a
have
not
students
consistently
note
extreme
difficulty
in
coordinating
schedules
with
friends
missing
important
phone
calls
from
employers
the
loss
of
social
status
that
comes
from
cell
phone
ownership
and
the
loss
of
social
connectedness
that
results
from
the
inability
to
communicate
with
friends
anytime
anywhere
one
student
recounted
how
he
often
provides
technical
support
to
his
friends
during
the
weekend
when
he
turned
off
his
mobile
phone
he
missing
a
late
night
call
from
a
frantic
friend
who
experienced
a
computer
problem
while
writing
up
a
term
paper
that
was
due
the
following
morning
as
a
result
the
student
was
faced
with
the
tough
task
of
repairing
his
relationship
with
his
friend
there
are
a
number
of
procedures
used
for
classwork
and
assignments
peer
teaching
is
used
in
nearly
every
class
students
sign
up
to
deliver
individual
presentations
that
correspond
to
the
topics
that
will
be
discussed
during
the
semester
in
these
presentations
students
find
current
news
articles
interesting
websites
youtube
videos
or
other
media
related
to
the
topic
that
they
chose
each
presentation
ends
with
a
class
discussion
in
response
to
two
probing
questions
developed
by
the
presenter
through
this
exercise
each
student
acts
as
a
teacher
for
the
group
additional
procedures
include
group
writing
using
wikis
journaling
using
blogs
small
research
projects
such
as
examining
privacy
and
identity
using
facebook
profiles
deconstructing
advertisements
for
technologyrelated
products
and
using
discussion
forums
to
generate
insights
about
characteristics
of
members
of
online
gaming
communities
teambased
research
projects
are
the
main
way
for
students
to
demonstrate
indepth
learning
experience
with
humans
and
icts
through
these
procedures
students
are
engaged
in
critical
questioning
problem
posing
and
research
that
enable
them
to
utilize
their
strengths
experiences
and
values
to
deepen
understanding
of
social
political
cultural
and
ethical
issues
that
exist
in
the
information
environment
implications
for
educators
the
social
justice
approach
has
several
implications
for
educators
first
educators
have
to
address
two
sources
of
power
asymmetry
in
the
classroom
the
educators
institutional
power
status
and
authority
and
the
educators
social
status
characteristics
such
as
race
gender
age
and
nationality
as
an
africanamerican
woman
teaching
undergraduate
courses
to
a
predominantly
white
male
student
population
there
are
clearly
many
ways
in
which
the
educator
and
students
are
not
alike
the
challenge
is
to
foster
a
classroom
environment
in
which
the
educators
authority
and
expertise
is
clarified
and
made
explicit
because
it
bears
on
grading
evaluation
and
classroom
norms
omolade
argues
that
authority
with
not
authority
over
is
complicated
by
social
status
differences
between
the
students
and
the
educator
female
educators
of
color
must
maintain
democratic
structures
to
foster
authority
with
students
once
this
mutual
respect
is
established
students
will
accept
greater
responsibility
for
establishing
an
active
and
engaged
learning
environment
second
the
instructor
must
create
a
safe
environment
that
encourages
discussion
silence
in
the
classroom
can
result
from
a
number
of
factors
including
fear
of
being
patronized
anger
anxiety
hostility
ignorance
or
resistance
to
being
forced
to
speak
for
hooks
silence
is
not
always
about
the
failure
to
make
an
utterance
sometimes
silence
is
the
fear
of
being
unable
to
make
a
speech
that
compels
others
to
listen
silence
can
be
the
fear
of
not
being
heard
educators
can
use
their
classroom
authority
to
create
a
safe
classroom
environment
that
compels
students
to
value
their
own
voice
by
establishing
classroom
norms
to
ensure
respect
and
the
amicable
resolution
of
conflicts
technologies
such
as
message
boards
where
students
can
post
comments
and
pointers
to
relevant
information
provide
another
means
by
which
students
can
participate
in
the
course
finally
educators
must
enable
students
to
understand
that
the
power
relations
that
exist
in
society
are
not
the
natural
order
of
things
the
privileges
that
we
enjoy
in
life
are
the
result
of
historically
constructed
forces
which
can
be
changed
as
future
information
technology
professionals
students
can
use
the
political
influence
resources
and
human
agency
to
create
and
implement
icts
that
are
socially
just
environmentally
benign
and
enable
positive
social
change
conclusion
social
justice
provides
a
useful
approach
for
infusing
ethics
and
multiculturalism
in
undergraduate
informatics
education
a
social
justice
pedagogy
for
the
study
of
ict
and
its
social
implications
would
necessarily
include
teaching
that
pays
attention
to
personal
safety
and
classroom
norms
begins
from
students
worldview
and
uses
students
experiences
as
a
basis
for
course
content
and
problemposing
this
studentcentered
approach
is
vastly
different
than
the
traditional
lecturediscussiontesting
mode
of
higher
education
that
has
existed
for
centuries
and
requires
a
shift
in
the
power
relations
between
students
and
educators
educators
seeking
to
adopt
a
social
justice
approach
may
do
so
in
incremental
steps
by
experimenting
with
different
assignments
and
classroom
activities
and
by
fostering
a
classroom
atmosphere
that
invites
everyone
to
speak
from
their
own
voice
of
experience
take
risks
and
learn
from
their
mistakes
social
justice
education
has
the
potential
to
prepare
students
who
are
able
to
critically
evaluate
the
intended
and
unintended
consequences
of
ict
adoption
and
use
sophisticated
in
their
understanding
of
social
institutions
in
shaping
the
meaning
and
intended
uses
of
ict
